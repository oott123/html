   <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
   <dd>

    <p>Entire novels have been written about the security considerations that apply to HTML
    documents. Many are listed in this document, to which the reader is referred for more details.
    Some general concerns bear mentioning here, however:</p>

    <p>HTML is scripted language, and has a large number of APIs (some of which are described in
    this document). Script can expose the user to potential risks of information leakage, credential
    leakage, cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgeries, and a host of other
    problems. While the designs in this specification are intended to be safe if implemented
    correctly, a full implementation is a massive undertaking and, as with any software, user agents
    are likely to have security bugs.</p>

    <p>Even without scripting, there are specific features in HTML which, for historical reasons,
    are required for broad compatibility with legacy content but that expose the user to unfortunate
    security problems. In particular, the <code>img</code> element can be used in conjunction with
    some other features as a way to effect a port scan from the user's location on the Internet.
    This can expose local network topologies that the attacker would otherwise not be able to
    determine.</p>

    <p>HTML relies on a compartmentalization scheme sometimes known as the <i>same-origin
    policy</i>. An <span>origin</span> in most cases consists of all the pages served from the same
    host, on the same port, using the same protocol.</p>

    <p>It is critical, therefore, to ensure that any untrusted content that forms part of a site be
    hosted on a different <span>origin</span> than any sensitive content on that site. Untrusted
    content can easily spoof any other page on the same origin, read data from that origin, cause
    scripts in that origin to execute, submit forms to and from that origin even if they are
    protected from cross-site request forgery attacks by unique tokens, and make use of any
    third-party resources exposed to or rights granted to that origin.</p>
