    Labeling a resource with the <code>application/microdata+json</code> type asserts that the
    resource is a JSON text that consists of an object with a single entry called "<code
    data-x="">items</code>" consisting of an array of entries, each of which consists of an object
    with an entry called "<code data-x="">id</code>" whose value is a string, an entry called "<code
    data-x="">type</code>" whose value is another string, and an entry called "<code
    data-x="">properties</code>" whose value is an object whose entries each have a value consisting
    of an array of either objects or strings, the objects being of the same form as the objects in
    the aforementioned "<code data-x="">items</code>" entry. Thus, the relevant specifications are
    the JSON specification and this specification. <ref spec=JSON>

  <p><span data-x="concept-url-fragment">Fragments</span> used with
  <code>application/microdata+json</code> resources have the same semantics as when used with
  <code>application/json</code> (namely, at the time of writing, no semantics at all).
