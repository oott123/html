<h3 id="parsing-xhtml-documents">Parsing XML documents</h3>

  <p>This section describes the relationship between XML and the DOM, with a particular emphasis on
  how this interacts with HTML.</p>

  <p>An <dfn data-export="">XML parser</dfn>, for the purposes of this specification, is a construct
  that follows the rules given in the XML specification to map a string of bytes or characters into
  a <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">At the time of writing, no such rules actually exist.</p><!--XMLPARSE-->

  <p>An <span>XML parser</span> is either associated with a <code>Document</code> object when it is
  created, or creates one implicitly.</p>

  <p>This <code>Document</code> must then be populated with DOM nodes that represent the tree
  structure of the input passed to the parser, as defined by the XML specification, the Namespaces
  in XML specification, and the WHATWG DOM standard. When creating DOM nodes representing elements,
  the <span data-x="create an element for the token">create an element for a token</span> algorithm
  or some equivalent that operates on appropriate XML datastructures must be used, to ensure the
  proper <span data-x="element interface">element interfaces</span> are created and that <span
  data-x="custom element">custom elements</span> are set up correctly.</p>

  <p>DOM mutation events must not fire for the operations that the <span>XML parser</span> performs
  on the <code>Document</code>'s tree, but the user agent must act as if elements and attributes
  were individually appended and set respectively so as to trigger rules in this specification
  regarding what happens when an element is inserted into a document or has its attributes set, and
  the WHATWG DOM standard's requirements regarding <span>mutation observers</span> mean that
  mutation observers <em>are</em> fired (unlike mutation events). <ref spec=XML> <ref spec=XMLNS>
  <ref spec=DOM> <ref spec=UIEVENTS></p>

  <p>Between the time an element's start tag is parsed and the time either the element's end tag is
  parsed or the parser detects a well-formedness error, the user agent must act as if the element
  was in a <span>stack of open elements</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">This is used, e.g. by the <code>object</code> element to avoid instantiating plugins
  before the <code>param</code> element children have been parsed.</p>

  <p>This specification provides the following additional information that user agents should use
  when retrieving an external entity: the public identifiers given in the following list all
  correspond to <a href="<!--BOILERPLATE entities-dtd.url-->">the URL given by this link</a>. (This
  URL is a DTD containing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-entity-decl">entity
  declarations</a> for the names listed in the <span>named character references</span> section.) <ref spec=XML></p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//W3C//DTD MathML 2.0//EN</code></li>
   <li><code data-x="">-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0//EN</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Furthermore, user agents should attempt to retrieve the above external entity's content when
  one of the above public identifiers is used, and should not attempt to retrieve any other external
  entity's content.</p>

  <p class="note">This is not strictly a <span data-x="willful violation">violation</span> of the XML
  specification, but it does contradict the spirit of the XML specification's requirements. This is
  motivated by a desire for user agents to all handle entities in an interoperable fashion without
  requiring any network access for handling external subsets. <ref spec=XML></p>

  <p>XML parsers can be invoked with <dfn data-export="">XML scripting support enabled</dfn> or <dfn
  data-export="">XML scripting support disabled</dfn>. Except where otherwise specified, XML parsers
  are invoked with <span>XML scripting support enabled</span>.</p>

  <p id="scriptTagXML">When an <span>XML parser</span> with <span>XML scripting support enabled</span>
  creates a <code>script</code> element, it
  must be marked as being <span>"parser-inserted"</span> and its <span>"non-blocking"</span> flag
  must be unset. If the parser was originally created for the <span>XML fragment parsing
  algorithm</span>, then the element must be marked as <span>"already started"</span> also. When the
  element's end tag is subsequently parsed, the user agent must <span>perform a microtask checkpoint</span>, and
  then <span data-x="prepare a script">prepare</span> the <code>script</code> element. If this
  causes there to be a <span>pending parsing-blocking script</span>, then the user agent must run
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Block this instance of the <span>XML parser</span>, such that the <span>event loop</span>
   will not run <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that invoke it.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Spin the event loop</span> until the parser's <code>Document</code> <span>has no
   style sheet that is blocking scripts</span> and the <span>pending parsing-blocking
   script</span>'s <span>"ready to be parser-executed"</span> flag is set.</p></li>

   <li><p>Unblock this instance of the <span>XML parser</span>, such that <span
   data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that invoke it can again be run.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="execute the script block">Execute</span> the <span>pending parsing-blocking
   script</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>There is no longer a <span>pending parsing-blocking script</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">Since the <code data-x="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> API is not
  available for <span>XML documents</span>, much of the complexity in the <span>HTML parser</span>
  is not needed in the <span>XML parser</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">When the <span>XML parser</span> has <span>XML scripting support disabled</span>,
  none of this happens.</p>

  <p id="templateTagXML">When an <span>XML parser</span> would append a node to a
  <code>template</code> element, it must instead append it to the <code>template</code> element's
  <span>template contents</span> (a <code>DocumentFragment</code> node).</p>

  <p class="note">This is a <span>willful violation</span> of the XML specification; unfortunately,
  XML is not formally extensible in the manner that is needed for <code>template</code> processing.
  <ref spec=XML></p>

  <p>When an <span>XML parser</span> creates a <code>Node</code> object, its <span>node document</span>
  must be set to the <span>node document</span> of
  the node into which the newly created node is to be inserted.</p>

  <p>Certain algorithms in this specification <dfn data-x="feed the parser">spoon-feed the
  parser</dfn> characters one string at a time. In such cases, the <span>XML parser</span> must act
  as it would have if faced with a single string consisting of the concatenation of all those
  characters.</p>

  <p>When an <span>XML parser</span> reaches the end of its input, it must <span>stop
  parsing</span>, following the same rules as the <span>HTML parser</span>. An <span>XML
  parser</span> can also be <span data-x="abort a parser">aborted</span>, which must again be done in
  the same way as for an <span>HTML parser</span>.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of conformance checkers, if a resource is determined to be in <span>the XML
  syntax</span>, then it is an <span data-x="XML documents">XML document</span>.</p>
