<h3 id="writing-xhtml-documents">Writing documents in the XML syntax</h3>

  </div>

  <p class="note">The XML syntax for HTML was formerly referred to as "XHTML", but this
  specification does not use that term (among other reasons, because no such term is used for the
  HTML syntaxes of MathML and SVG).</p>

  <p>The syntax for XML is defined in the XML and Namespaces in XML specifications. <ref spec=XML>
  <ref spec=XMLNS></p>

  <p>This specification does not define any syntax-level requirements beyond those defined for XML
  proper.</p>

  <p>XML documents may contain a <code data-x="">DOCTYPE</code> if desired, but this is not required
  to conform to this specification. This specification does not define a public or system
  identifier, nor provide a formal DTD.</p>

  <p class="note">According to the XML specification, XML processors are not guaranteed to process
  the external DTD subset referenced in the DOCTYPE. This means, for example, that using <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#dt-entref">entity references</a> for characters in XML documents
  is unsafe if they are defined in an external file (except for <code data-x="">&amp;lt;</code>,
  <code data-x="">&amp;gt;</code>, <code data-x="">&amp;amp;</code>, <code data-x="">&amp;quot;</code>
  and <code data-x="">&amp;apos;</code>).</p>
