<h5>Dedicated workers and the <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code> interface</h5>

  <pre class="idl">[Global=(Worker,DedicatedWorker),Exposed=DedicatedWorker]
interface <dfn>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</dfn> : <span>WorkerGlobalScope</span> {
  void <span data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-postMessage">postMessage</span>(any message, optional sequence&lt;<span data-x="idl-object">object</span>&gt; transfer = []);

  void <span data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-close">close</span>();

  attribute <span>EventHandler</span> <span data-x="handler-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-onmessage">onmessage</span>;
};</pre>

  <p><code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code> objects act as if they had an implicit
  <code>MessagePort</code> associated with them. This port is part of a channel that is set up when
  the worker is created, but it is not exposed. This object must never be garbage collected before
  the <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object.</p>

  <p>All messages received by that port must immediately be retargeted at the
  <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object.</p>

  <dl class="domintro">
   <dt><var>dedicatedWorkerGlobal</var> . <code subdfn
   data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-postMessage">postMessage</code>(<var>message</var> [,
   <var>transfer</var> ])</dt>
   <dd>Clones <var>message</var> and transmits it to the <code>Worker</code> object associated with
   <var>dedicatedWorkerGlobal</var>. <var>transfer</var> can be passed as a list of objects that are
   to be transferred rather than cloned.</dd>

   <dt><var>dedicatedWorkerGlobal</var> . <code subdfn
   data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-close">close</code>()</dt>
   <dd>Aborts <var>dedicatedWorkerGlobal</var>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-postMessage">postMessage()</code></dfn>
  method on <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code> objects must act as if, when invoked, it
  immediately invoked <span data-x="dom-MessagePort-postMessage">the method of the same name</span>
  on the port, with the same arguments, and returned the same return value.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>To <dfn data-export="">close a worker</dfn>, given a <var>workerGlobal</var>, run these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Discard any <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that have been added to
   <var>workerGlobal</var>'s <span>event loop</span>'s <span data-x="task queue">task
   queues</span>.</p>

   <li><p>Set <var>workerGlobal</var>'s <span data-x="dom-WorkerGlobalScope-closing">closing</span>
   flag to true. (This prevents any further tasks from being queued.)</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-close">close()</code></dfn> method, when
  invoked, must <span>close a worker</span> with this <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code>
  object.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>The following are the <span>event handlers</span> (and their corresponding <span data-x="event
  handler event type">event handler event types</span>) that must be supported, as <span>event
  handler IDL attributes</span>, by objects implementing the <code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code>
  interface:</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr><th><span data-x="event handlers">Event handler</span> <th><span>Event handler event type</span>
   <tbody>
    <tr><td><dfn><code data-x="handler-DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope-onmessage">onmessage</code></dfn> <td> <code data-x="event-message">message</code>
  </table>

  <p>For the purposes of the <span>application cache</span> networking model, a dedicated worker is
  an extension of the <span>cache host</span> from which it was created.</p>
