  <h3>Infrastructure</h3>

  <p>There are two kinds of workers; dedicated workers, and shared workers. Dedicated workers, once
  created, are linked to their creator; but message ports can be used to communicate from a
  dedicated worker to multiple other browsing contexts or workers. Shared workers, on the other
  hand, are named, and once created any script running in the same <span>origin</span> can obtain a
  reference to that worker and communicate with it.</p>
