  <h4>The worker's lifetime</h4>

  <p>Workers communicate with other workers and with <span data-x="browsing context">browsing
  contexts</span> through <span data-x="channel messaging">message channels</span> and their
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects.</p>

  <p>Each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> <var>worker global scope</var> has a list of
  <dfn data-export="">the worker's ports</dfn>, which consists of all the <code>MessagePort</code>
  objects that are entangled with another port and that have one (but only one) port owned by
  <var>worker global scope</var>. This list includes <!--all the <code>MessagePort</code> objects
  that are in events pending in the <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object's <span>event loop</span>,
  as well as (commented out because in practice it makes no difference either way as far as I can
  tell, and it would be hard to strictly implement since these ports might not yet be across the
  thread boundary)--> the implicit <code>MessagePort</code> in the case of <span
  data-x="DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope">dedicated workers</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> also has a list of <dfn data-export="">the worker's
  workers</dfn>. Initially this list is empty; it is populated when the worker creates or obtains
  further workers.</p>

  <p>Finally, each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> also has a list of <dfn data-export="">the
  worker's <code>Document</code>s</dfn>. Initially this list is empty; it is populated when the
  worker is created.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <code>Document</code> <var>d</var> is <dfn data-x="add a document to the
  worker's Documents">added to the worker's <code>Document</code>s</dfn>, the user agent must, for
  each worker <var>q</var> in the list of <span>the worker's workers</span> whose list of
  <span>the worker's <code>Document</code>s</span> does not contain <var>d</var>, <span
  data-x="add a document to the worker's Documents">add <var>d</var> to <var>q</var>'s <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> owner's list of <span>the worker's
  <code>Document</code>s</span></span>.</p> <!-- suggestions welcome on making this sentence into
  understandable English -->

  <p>Whenever a <code>Document</code> object is <span data-x="discard a Document">discarded</span>,
  it must be removed from the list of <span>the worker's <code>Document</code>s</span> of each
  worker whose list contains that <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>Given an <span>environment settings object</span> <var>o</var> when creating or obtaining a
  worker, the <dfn>list of relevant <code>Document</code> objects to add</dfn> depends on the type
  of <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> specified by <var>o</var>.
  If <var>o</var> specifies a <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span>
  that is a <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object (i.e. if we are creating a nested worker), then
  the relevant <code>Document</code>s are the <span>the worker's <code>Document</code>s</span> of
  the <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> specified by <var>o</var>.
  Otherwise, <var>o</var> specifies a <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global
  object</span> that is a <code>Window</code> object, and the relevant <code>Document</code> is just
  the <span>responsible document</span> specified by <var>o</var>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>permissible worker</dfn> if its list of <span>the worker's
  <code>Document</code>s</span> is not empty, or if its list has been empty for no more than a short
  user-agent-defined timeout value, its <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> is actually a
  <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object (i.e. the worker is a shared worker), and the user
  agent has a <span>browsing context</span> whose <code>Document</code> is not <span>completely
  loaded</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The second part of this definition allows a shared worker to survive for a short
  time while a page is loading, in case that page is going to contact the shared worker again. This
  can be used by user agents as a way to avoid the cost of restarting a shared worker used by a site
  when the user is navigating from page to page within that site.</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be an <dfn>active needed worker</dfn> if any of the <code>Document</code>
  objects in <span>the worker's <code>Document</code>s</span> are <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>protected worker</dfn> if it is an <span>active needed
  worker</span> and either it has outstanding timers, database transactions, or network connections,
  or its list of <span>the worker's ports</span> is not empty, or its <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code>
  is actually a <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object (i.e. the worker is a shared
  worker).</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>suspendable worker</dfn> if it is not an <span>active needed
  worker</span> but it is a <span>permissible worker</span>.</p>
