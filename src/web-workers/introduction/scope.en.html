  <h4>Scope</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification defines an API for running scripts in the background independently of any
  user interface scripts.</p>

  <p>This allows for long-running scripts that are not interrupted by scripts that respond to clicks
  or other user interactions, and allows long tasks to be executed without yielding to keep the page
  responsive.</p>

  <p>Workers (as these background scripts are called herein) are relatively heavy-weight, and are
  not intended to be used in large numbers. For example, it would be inappropriate to launch one
  worker for each pixel of a four megapixel image. The examples below show some appropriate uses of
  workers.</p>

  <p>Generally, workers are expected to be long-lived, have a high start-up performance cost, and a
  high per-instance memory cost.</p>
