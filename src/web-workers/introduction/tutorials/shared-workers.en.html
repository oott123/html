<h5 data-dfn-type="dfn" data-lt="shared worker" data-export="">Shared workers</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Shared workers are identified by the URL of the script used to create it, optionally with an
  explicit name. The name allows multiple instances of a particular shared worker to be started.</p>

  <p>Shared workers are scoped by <span>origin</span>. Two different sites using the same names will
  not collide. However, if a page tries to use the same shared worker name as another page on the
  same site, but with a different script URL, it will fail.</p>

  <p>Creating shared workers is done using the <code data-x="dom-SharedWorker">SharedWorker()</code>
  constructor. This constructor takes the URL to the script to use for its first argument, and the
  name of the worker, if any, as the second argument.</p>

  <pre>var worker = new SharedWorker('service.js');</pre>

  <p>Communicating with shared workers is done with explicit <code>MessagePort</code> objects. The
  object returned by the <code data-x="dom-SharedWorker">SharedWorker()</code> constructor holds a
  reference to the port on its <code data-x="dom-SharedWorker-port">port</code> attribute.</p>

  <pre>worker.port.onmessage = function (event) { ... };
worker.port.postMessage('some message');
worker.port.postMessage({ foo: 'structured', bar: ['data', 'also', 'possible']});</pre>

  <p>Inside the shared worker, new clients of the worker are announced using the <code
  data-x="event-WorkerGlobalScope-connect">connect</code> event. The port for the new client is
  given by the event object's <code data-x="dom-messageevent-source">source</code> attribute.</p>

  <pre>onconnect = function (event) {
  var newPort = event.source;
  // set up a listener
  newPort.onmessage = function (event) { ... };
  // send a message back to the port
  newPort.postMessage('ready!'); // can also send structured data, of course
};</pre>
