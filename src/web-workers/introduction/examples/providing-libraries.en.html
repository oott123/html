  <h5>Providing libraries</h5>

  <!- - NON-NORMATIVE SECTION - ->

  <p>Suppose that a cryptography library is made available that provides three tasks:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Generate a public/private key pair</dt>

   <dd>Takes a port, on which it will send two messages, first the public key and then the private
   key.</dd>

   <dt>Given a plaintext and a public key, return the corresponding cyphertext</dt>

   <dd>Takes a port, to which any number of messages can be sent, the first giving the public key,
   and the remainder giving the plaintext, each of which is encrypted and then sent on that same
   channel as the cyphertext. The user can close the port when it is done encrypting content.</dd>

   <dt>Given a cyphertext and a private key, return the corresponding plaintext</dt>

   <dd>Takes a port, to which any number of messages can be sent, the first giving the private key,
   and the remainder giving the cyphertext, each of which is decrypted and then sent on that same
   channel as the plaintext. The user can close the port when it is done decrypting content.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The library itself is as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/libcrypto-v1.js</pre>

  <p>Note that the crypto functions here are just stubs and don't do real cryptography.</p>

  <p>This library could be used as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/page.html</pre>

  <p>A later version of the API, though, might want to offload all the crypto work onto subworkers.
  This could be done as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/libcrypto-v2.js</pre>

  <p>The little subworkers would then be as follows.</p>

  <p>For generating key pairs:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/libcrypto-v2-generator.js</pre>

  <p>For encrypting:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/libcrypto-v2-encryptor.js</pre>

  <p>For decrypting:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/crypto/libcrypto-v2-decryptor.js</pre>

  <p>Notice how the users of the API don't have to even know that this is happening &mdash; the API
  hasn't changed; the library can delegate to subworkers without changing its API, even though it is
  accepting data using message channels.</p>
