<h5>Shared workers introduction</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This section introduces shared workers using a Hello World example. Shared workers use slightly
  different APIs, since each worker can have multiple connections.</p>

  <p>This first example shows how you connect to a worker and how a worker can send a message back
  to the page when it connects to it. Received messages are displayed in a log.</p>

  <p>Here is the HTML page:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/001/test.html</pre>

  <p>Here is the JavaScript worker:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/001/test.js</pre>

  <p><a href="/demos/workers/shared/001/test.html">View this example online</a>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>This second example extends the first one by changing two things: first, messages are received
  using <code data-x="">addEventListener()</code> instead of an <span data-x="event handler IDL
  attributes">event handler IDL attribute</span>, and second, a message is sent <em>to</em> the
  worker, causing the worker to send another message in return. Received messages are again
  displayed in a log.</p>

  <p>Here is the HTML page:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/002/test.html</pre>

  <p>Here is the JavaScript worker:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/002/test.js</pre>

  <p><a href="/demos/workers/shared/002/test.html">View this example online</a>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Finally, the example is extended to show how two pages can connect to the same worker; in this
  case, the second page is merely in an <code>iframe</code> on the first page, but the same
  principle would apply to an entirely separate page in a separate <span>top-level browsing
  context</span>.</p>

  <p>Here is the outer HTML page:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/003/test.html</pre>

  <p>Here is the inner HTML page:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/003/inner.html</pre>

  <p>Here is the JavaScript worker:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/shared/003/test.js</pre>

  <p><a href="/demos/workers/shared/003/test.html">View this example online</a>.</p>
