<h5>Worker used for background I/O</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>In this example, the main document uses two workers, one for fetching stock updates at regular
  intervals, and one for performing search queries that the user requests.</p>

  <p>The main page is as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/stocks/page.html</pre>

  <p>The two workers use a common library for performing the actual network calls. This library is
  as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/stocks/io.js</pre>

  <p>The stock updater worker is as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/stocks/ticker.js</pre>

  <p>The search query worker is as follows:</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE workers/stocks/searcher.js</pre>
