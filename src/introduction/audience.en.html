<h3>Audience</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features
  defined in this specification<span w-nodev>, implementors of tools that operate on pages that
  use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the
  correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this
  specification</span>.</p>

  <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
  familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
  for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
  introduction to the topic.</p>

  <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of
  some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML,
  Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
  essential.</p>
