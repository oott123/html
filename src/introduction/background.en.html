  <h3>Background</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a
  language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has
  enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of
  documents and even applications.</p>
