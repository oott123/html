<h3 id="fingerprint">Privacy concerns</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.</p>

  <p>In general, due to the Internet's architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
  user's IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
  device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
  servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
  actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further
  anonymize requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come
  from many disparate parts of the network.</p>

  <p>However, the IP address used for a user's requests is not the only mechanism by which a user's
  requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
  this, and are the basis of most of the Web's session features that enable you to log into a site
  with which you have an account.</p>

  <p>There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user's system can
  be used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
  individual user's browser's "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
  better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.</p>

  <p>Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
  (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
  reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
  with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
  the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
  visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
  information such as the person's home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
  driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by
  examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be
  prevented from voting in an election.</p>

  <p>Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
  consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
  to fingerprint a user.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit
  to be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting
  purposes, so it's not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to
  log into a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user's requests be
  identifiable as all being from the same user, more or less by definition. More subtly, though,
  information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing
  text onto a canvas (e.g. any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks
  information that can be used to group a user's requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing,
  via a brute force search, which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary
  considerably from user to user.)</p>

  <p>Features in this specification which can be <dfn data-x="fingerprinting vector">used to
  fingerprint the user</dfn> are marked as this paragraph is.

  <p>Other features in the platform can be used for the same purpose, though, including, though not
  limited to:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The exact list of which features a user agents supports.</li>

   <li>The maximum allowed stack depth for recursion in script.</li>

   <li>Features that describe the user's environment, like Media Queries and the <code>Screen</code>
   object. <ref spec=MQ> <ref spec=CSSOMVIEW></li>

   <li>The user's time zone.</li>

  </ul>
