  <h3>Structure of this specification</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>

  <dl>


   <dt><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></dt>

   <dd>Non-normative materials providing a context for the HTML standard.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#infrastructure">Common infrastructure</a></dt>

   <dd>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the rest of
   the specification.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#dom">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a></dt>

   <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section
   defines the features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all elements, and
   the concepts used in defining elements.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#semantics">The elements of HTML</a></dt>

   <dd>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors
   on how to use the element<span w-nodev>, along with user agent requirements for how to
   handle each element,</span> are also given. This includes large signature features of HTML such
   as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form submission, and a 2D graphics API known
   as the HTML canvas.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#microdata">Microdata</a></dt>

   <dd>This specification introduces a mechanism for adding machine-readable annotations to
   documents, so that tools can extract trees of name-value pairs from the document. This section
   describes this mechanism<span w-nodev> and some algorithms that can be used to convert HTML
   documents into other formats</span>. This section also defines some sample Microdata vocabularies
   for contact information, calendar events, and licensing works.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#editing">User interaction</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify
   content, which are described in this section, such as how focus works, and drag-and-drop.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#browsers">Loading Web pages</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; this section defines many of the features
   that affect environments that deal with multiple pages, such as Web browsers and offline
   caching of Web applications.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#webappapis">Web application APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>This section introduces basic features for scripting of applications in HTML.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#workers">Web workers</a></dt>

   <dd>This section defines an API for background threads in JavaScript.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#comms">The communication APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>This section describes some mechanisms that applications written in HTML can use to
   communicate with other applications from different domains running on the same client. It also
   introduces a server-push event stream mechanism known as Server Sent Events or
   <code>EventSource</code>, and a two-way full-duplex socket protocol for scripts known as Web
   Sockets.

   </dd>


   <dt><a href="#webstorage">Web storage</a></dt>

   <dd>This section defines a client-side storage mechanism based on name-value pairs.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#syntax">The HTML syntax</a></dt>
   <dt><a href="#xhtml">The XML syntax</a></dt>

   <dd>All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be represented in a serialized
   form and sent to other people, and so these sections define the syntaxes of HTML and XML<span
   w-nodev>, along with rules for how to parse content using those syntaxes</span>.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#rendering">Rendering</a></dt>

   <dd>This section defines the default rendering rules for Web browsers.</dd>


  </dl>

  <p>There are also some appendices, listing <a href="#obsolete">obsolete features</a> and <a
  href="#iana">IANA considerations</a>, and several indices.</p>
