  <h4>How to read this specification</h4>

  <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
  cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be
  read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.</p>

  <p>As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
  conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
  requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create,
  and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers.
  They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is
  allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, "the <code data-x="">foo</code> attribute's value must be a <span>valid
   integer</span>" is a requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast,
   the requirement "the <code data-x="">foo</code> attribute's value must be parsed using the
   <span>rules for parsing integers</span>" is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to
   process the content.</p>

  </div>

  <p><strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong></p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute's value is
   constrained to being a <span>valid integer</span> emphatically does <em>not</em> imply anything
   about the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact required to treat
   the attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the value conforms to the
   requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the consumers are required to
   parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid (non-numeric in this case) values
   are to be processed.</p>
