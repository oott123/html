<h3 id="html-vs-xhtml">HTML vs XML syntax</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
  some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>

  <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.</p>

  <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this
  abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.</p>

  <p>The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most
  authors. It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
  <code>text/html</code> <span>MIME type</span>, then it will be processed as an HTML document by
  Web browsers. This specification defines the latest HTML syntax, known simply as "HTML".</p>

  <p>The second concrete syntax is XML. When a document is transmitted with an <span>XML MIME
  type</span>, such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, then it is treated as an XML document by
  Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors are reminded that the processing for XML
  and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a document labeled as XML
  from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in the HTML syntax.</p>

  <p class="note">The XML syntax for HTML was formerly referred to as "XHTML", but this
  specification does not use that term (among other reasons, because no such term is used for the
  HTML syntaxes of MathML and SVG).</p>

  <p>The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For
  example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the DOM
  and in the XML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <code>noscript</code> feature can be
  represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XML syntax.
  Comments that contain the string "<code data-x="">--&gt;</code>" can only be represented in the
  DOM, not in the HTML and XML syntaxes.</p>
