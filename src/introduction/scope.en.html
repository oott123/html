  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
  semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
  documents to dynamic applications.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
  customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of
  the language).</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
  hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
  applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
  to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
  CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
  systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
  communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document
  editing software, etc.</p>
