  <h3>Design notes</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
  inconsistent.</p>

  <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been
  developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities
  who, in many cases, did not know of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
  consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
  bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
  written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.</p>

  <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
  in the next few subsections.</p>
