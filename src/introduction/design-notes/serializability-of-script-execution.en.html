  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
  designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
  with <span data-x="Worker">workers</span>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can
  be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <span data-x="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span>.</p>
