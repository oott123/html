  <h4>Extensibility</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a
  safe manner:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>Authors can use the <code data-x="attr-class">class</code> attribute to extend elements,
   effectively creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML
   element, so that browsers and other tools that don't know of the extension can still support it
   somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts
   to process using the <code data-x="attr-data-*">data-*=""</code> attributes. These are guaranteed
   to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts
   can then look for and process.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can use the <code data-x="meta">&lt;meta name="" content=""></code> mechanism to
   include page-wide metadata by registering <span data-x="concept-meta-extensions">extensions to
   the predefined set of metadata names</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can use the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel=""</code> mechanism to annotate
   links with specific meanings by registering <span data-x="concept-rel-extensions">extensions to
   the predefined set of link types</span>. This is also used by microformats.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can embed raw data using the <code data-x="script">&lt;script type=""></code>
   mechanism with a custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can create <span data-x="plugin">plugins</span> and invoke them using the
   <code>embed</code> element. This is how Flash works.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by
   script libraries, for instance.</p></li>

   <li><p>Authors can use the microdata feature (the <code
   data-x="attr-itemscope">itemscope=""</code> and <code data-x="attr-itemprop">itemprop=""</code>
   attributes) to embed nested name-value pairs of data to be shared with other applications and
   sites.</p></li>

  </ul>
