  <h3>Conformance requirements for authors</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail
  the required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.</p> <!-- This has led to
  some questioning the purpose of conformance criteria: if there is no ambiguity in how something
  will be processed, why disallow it? -->

  <p>However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined,
  conformance requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the
  situation in which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or
  equivalent way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details
  some of the more common reasons for still distinguishing between a conforming document and one
  with errors.</p>
