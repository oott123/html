  <h4>Syntax errors</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>The syntax of HTML is constrained to avoid a wide variety of problems.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Unintuitive error-handling behavior</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain invalid syntax constructs, when parsed, result in DOM trees that are highly
    unintuitive.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the following markup fragment results in a DOM with an <code>hr</code> element
     that is an <em>earlier</em> sibling of the corresponding <code>table</code> element:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors with optional error recovery</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>To allow user agents to be used in controlled environments without having to implement the
    more bizarre and convoluted error handling rules, user agents are permitted to fail whenever
    encountering a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors where the error-handling behavior is not compatible with streaming user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some error-handling behavior, such as the behavior for the <code
    data-x="">&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</code> example mentioned above, are incompatible with streaming
    user agents (user agents that process HTML files in one pass, without storing state). To avoid
    interoperability problems with such user agents, any syntax resulting in such behavior is
    considered invalid.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that can result in infoset coercion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When a user agent based on XML is connected to an HTML parser, it is possible that certain
    invariants that XML enforces, such as element or attribute names never contain multiple colons,
    will be violated by an HTML file. Handling this can require that the parser coerce the HTML DOM
    into an XML-compatible infoset. Most syntax constructs that require such handling are considered
    invalid. (Comments containing two consecutive hyphens, or ending with a hyphen, are exceptions
    that are allowed in the HTML syntax.)</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that result in disproportionately poor performance</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs can result in disproportionately poor performance. To discourage the
    use of such constructs, they are typically made non-conforming.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the following markup results in poor performance, since all the unclosed
     <code>i</code> elements have to be reconstructed in each paragraph, resulting in progressively
     more elements in each paragraph:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;p>&lt;i>She dreamt.
&lt;p>&lt;i>She dreamt that she ate breakfast.
&lt;p>&lt;i>Then lunch.
&lt;p>&lt;i>And finally dinner.</pre>

     <p>The resulting DOM for this fragment would be:</p>

     <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><code>p</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span data-x="">She dreamt.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><code>p</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span data-x="">She dreamt that she ate breakfast.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><code>p</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span data-x="">Then lunch.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><code>p</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t1"><code>i</code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span data-x="">And finally dinner.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving fragile syntax constructs</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
    reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
    non-conforming.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
     with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
     letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
     string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
     character instead.</p>

     <p>In this fragment, the attribute's value is "<code data-x="">?bill&amp;ted</code>":</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>In the following fragment, however, the attribute's value is actually "<code
     data-x="">?art&copy;</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code data-x="">?art&amp;copy</code>",
     because even without the final semicolon, "<code data-x="">&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
     as "<code data-x="">&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code
     data-x="">&copy;</code>":</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;a href="?art&amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a semicolon,
     and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as errors.</p>

     <p>Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as
     follows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a> &lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it's not a named character reference --></pre>
     <pre>&lt;a href="?art&amp;amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a> &lt;!-- the &amp; has to be escaped, since &amp;copy <em>is</em> a named character reference --></pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving known interoperability problems in legacy user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs are known to cause especially subtle or serious problems in legacy
    user agents, and are therefore marked as non-conforming to help authors avoid them.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, this is why the U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT character (`) is not allowed in unquoted
     attributes. In certain legacy user agents, <!-- namely IE --> it is sometimes treated as a
     quote character.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Another example of this is the DOCTYPE, which is required to trigger <span>no-quirks
     mode</span>, because the behavior of legacy user agents in <span>quirks mode</span> is often
     largely undocumented.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


<!--ADD-TOPIC:Security-->
   <dt>Errors that risk exposing authors to security attacks</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions exist purely to avoid known security problems.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the restriction on using UTF-7 exists purely to avoid authors falling prey to a
     known cross-site-scripting attack using UTF-7. <ref spec=UTF7></p>

    </div>

   </dd>
<!--REMOVE-TOPIC:Security-->


   <dt>Cases where the author's intent is unclear</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Markup where the author's intent is very unclear is often made non-conforming. Correcting
    these errors early makes later maintenance easier.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, it is unclear whether the author intended the following to be an
     <code>h1</code> heading or an <code>h2</code> heading:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;h1>Contact details&lt;/h2></pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Cases that are likely to be typos</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When a user makes a simple typo, it is helpful if the error can be caught early, as this can
    save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it an
    error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names defined
    in this specification.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, if the author typed <code data-x="">&lt;capton></code> instead of <code
     data-x="">&lt;caption></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author could correct
     the typo immediately.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that could interfere with new syntax in the future</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In order to allow the language syntax to be extended in the future, certain otherwise
    harmless features are disallowed.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, "attributes" in end tags are ignored currently, but they are invalid, in case a
     future change to the language makes use of that syntax feature without conflicting with
     already-deployed (and valid!) content.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


  </dl>

  <p>Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
  including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
  benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
  authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
  enforced.</p>
