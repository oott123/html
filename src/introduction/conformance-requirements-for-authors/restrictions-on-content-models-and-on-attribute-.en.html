<h4>Restrictions on content models and on attribute values</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Beyond the syntax of the language, this specification also places restrictions on how elements
  and attributes can be specified. These restrictions are present for similar reasons:</p>

  <dl>


   <dt>Errors involving content with dubious semantics</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>To avoid misuse of elements with defined meanings, content models are defined that restrict
    how elements can be nested when such nestings would be of dubious value.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, this specification disallows nesting a <code>section</code>
    element inside a <code>kbd</code> element, since it is highly unlikely for an author to indicate
    that an entire section should be keyed in.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve a conflict in expressed semantics</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Similarly, to draw the author's attention to mistakes in the use of elements, clear
    contradictions in the semantics expressed are also considered conformance errors.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the fragments below, for example, the semantics are nonsensical: a separator cannot
     simultaneously be a cell, nor can a radio button be a progress bar.</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;hr role="cell"></pre>
     <pre class="bad">&lt;input type=radio role=progressbar></pre>

    </div>

    <p class="example">Another example is the restrictions on the content models of the
    <code>ul</code> element, which only allows <code>li</code> element children. Lists by definition
    consist just of zero or more list items, so if a <code>ul</code> element contains something
    other than an <code>li</code> element, it's not clear what was meant.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Cases where the default styles are likely to lead to confusion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain elements have default styles or behaviors that make certain combinations likely to
    lead to confusion. Where these have equivalent alternatives without this problem, the confusing
    combinations are disallowed.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, <code>div</code> elements are rendered as <span
    data-x="block box">block boxes</span>, and <code>span</code> elements as <span
    data-x="inline box">inline boxes</span>. Putting a <span>block box</span> in an
    <span>inline box</span> is unnecessarily confusing; since either nesting just <code>div</code>
    elements, or nesting just <code>span</code> elements, or nesting <code>span</code> elements
    inside <code>div</code> elements all serve the same purpose as nesting a <code>div</code>
    element in a <code>span</code> element, but only the latter involves a <span>block box</span> in
    an <span>inline box</span>, the latter combination is disallowed.</p>

    <p class="example">Another example would be the way <span>interactive content</span> cannot be
    nested. For example, a <code>button</code> element cannot contain a <code>textarea</code>
    element. This is because the default behavior of such nesting interactive elements would be
    highly confusing to users. Instead of nesting these elements, they can be placed side by
    side.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that indicate a likely misunderstanding of the specification</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Sometimes, something is disallowed because allowing it would likely cause author
    confusion.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, setting the <code data-x="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code>
    attribute to the value "<code data-x="">false</code>" is disallowed, because despite the
    appearance of meaning that the element is enabled, it in fact means that the element is
    <em>disabled</em> (what matters for implementations is the presence of the attribute, not its
    value).</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving limits that have been imposed merely to simplify the language</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some conformance errors simplify the language that authors need to learn.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, the <code>area</code> element's <code
    data-x="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute, despite accepting both <code
    data-x="attr-area-shape-keyword-circ">circ</code> and <code
    data-x="attr-area-shape-keyword-circle">circle</code> values in practice as synonyms, disallows
    the use of the <code data-x="attr-area-shape-keyword-circ">circ</code> value, so as to simplify
    tutorials and other learning aids. There would be no benefit to allowing both, but it would
    cause extra confusion when teaching the language.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve peculiarities of the parser</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain elements are parsed in somewhat eccentric ways (typically for historical reasons),
    and their content model restrictions are intended to avoid exposing the author to these
    issues.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, a <code>form</code> element isn't allowed inside <span>phrasing content</span>,
     because when parsed as HTML, a <code>form</code> element's start tag will imply a
     <code>p</code> element's end tag. Thus, the following markup results in two <span
     data-x="paragraph">paragraphs</span>, not one:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>

     <p>It is parsed exactly like the following:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;/p>&lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that would likely result in scripts failing in hard-to-debug ways</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some errors are intended to help prevent script problems that would be hard to debug.</p>

    <p class="example">This is why, for instance, it is non-conforming to have two <code
    data-x="attr-id">id</code> attributes with the same value. Duplicate IDs lead to the wrong
    element being selected, with sometimes disastrous effects whose cause is hard to determine.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that waste authoring time</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some constructs are disallowed because historically they have been the cause of a lot of
    wasted authoring time, and by encouraging authors to avoid making them, authors can save time in
    future efforts.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, a <code>script</code> element's <code
    data-x="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute causes the element's contents to be ignored.
    However, this isn't obvious, especially if the element's contents appear to be executable script
    &mdash; which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug the inline script
    without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this specification makes it
    non-conforming to have executable script in a <code>script</code> element when the <code
    data-x="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute is present. This means that authors who are
    validating their documents are less likely to waste time with this kind of mistake.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve areas that affect authors migrating between the HTML and XML
   syntaxes</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some authors like to write files that can be interpreted as both XML and HTML with similar
    results. Though this practice is discouraged in general due to the myriad of subtle
    complications involved (especially when involving scripting, styling, or any kind of automated
    serialization), this specification has a few restrictions intended to at least somewhat mitigate
    the difficulties. This makes it easier for authors to use this as a transitionary step when
    migrating between the HTML and XML syntaxes.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, there are somewhat complicated rules surrounding the <code
    data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> and <code data-x="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attributes
    intended to keep the two synchronized.</p>

    <p class="example">Another example would be the restrictions on the values of <code
    data-x="">xmlns</code> attributes in the HTML serialization, which are intended to ensure that
    elements in conforming documents end up in the same namespaces whether processed as HTML or
    XML.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve areas reserved for future expansion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>As with the restrictions on the syntax intended to allow for new syntax in future revisions
    of the language, some restrictions on the content models of elements and values of attributes
    are intended to allow for future expansion of the HTML vocabulary.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, limiting the values of the <code
    data-x="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code> attribute that start with an U+005F LOW LINE
    character (_) to only specific predefined values allows new predefined values to be introduced
    at a future time without conflicting with author-defined values.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that indicate a mis-use of other specifications</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions are intended to support the restrictions made by other
    specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, requiring that attributes that take media query lists use only
    <em>valid</em> media query lists reinforces the importance of following the conformance rules of
    that specification.</p>

   </dd>
