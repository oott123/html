  <p id="security-4" class="warning">Use of this API requires extra care to protect users from
  hostile entities abusing a site for their own purposes.</p>

  <p>Authors should check the <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</code> attribute to
  ensure that messages are only accepted from domains that they expect to receive messages from.
  Otherwise, bugs in the author's message handling code could be exploited by hostile sites.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even after checking the <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</code>
  attribute, authors should also check that the data in question is of the expected format.
  Otherwise, if the source of the event has been attacked using a cross-site scripting flaw, further
  unchecked processing of information sent using the <code
  data-x="dom-window-postMessage">postMessage()</code> method could result in the attack being
  propagated into the receiver.</p>

  <p>Authors should not use the wildcard keyword (*) in the <var>targetOrigin</var>
  argument in messages that contain any confidential information, as otherwise there is no way to
  guarantee that the message is only delivered to the recipient to which it was intended.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Authors who accept messages from any origin are encouraged to consider the risks of a
  denial-of-service attack. An attacker could send a high volume of messages; if the receiving page
  performs expensive computation or causes network traffic to be sent for each such message, the
  attacker's message could be multiplied into a denial-of-service attack. Authors are encouraged to
  employ rate limiting (only accepting a certain number of messages per minute) to make such attacks
  impractical.</p>
