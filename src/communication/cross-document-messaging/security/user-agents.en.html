<h5>User agents</h5>

  <p>The integrity of this API is based on the inability for scripts of one <span>origin</span> to
  post arbitrary events (using <code data-x="">dispatchEvent()</code> or otherwise) to objects in
  other origins (those that are not the <span data-x="same origin">same</span>).</p>

  <p class="note">Implementors are urged to take extra care in the implementation of this feature.
  It allows authors to transmit information from one domain to another domain, which is normally
  disallowed for security reasons. It also requires that UAs be careful to allow access to certain
  properties but not others.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>User agents are also encouraged to consider rate-limiting message traffic between different
  <span data-x="origin">origins</span>, to protect na&iuml;ve sites from denial-of-service
  attacks.</p>
