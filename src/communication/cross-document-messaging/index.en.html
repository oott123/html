<h3 id="web-messaging"><dfn id="crossDocumentMessages">Cross-document messaging</dfn></h3>

  <p>Web browsers, for security and privacy reasons, prevent documents in different domains from
  affecting each other; that is, cross-site scripting is disallowed.</p>

  <p>While this is an important security feature, it prevents pages from different domains from
  communicating even when those pages are not hostile. This section introduces a messaging system
  that allows documents to communicate with each other regardless of their source domain, in a way
  designed to not enable cross-site scripting attacks.</p>

  <p class="note">This API <a href="#fingerprint-postMessage">has some privacy implications</a> that
  may not be immediately obvious.</p>
