<h5>Ports as the basis of an object-capability model on the Web</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Ports can be viewed as a way to expose limited capabilities (in the object-capability model
  sense) to other actors in the system. This can either be a weak capability system, where the ports
  are merely used as a convenient model within a particular origin, or as a strong capability model,
  where they are provided by one origin <var>provider</var> as the only mechanism by which
  another origin <var>consumer</var> can effect change in or obtain information from <var>provider</var>.</p>

  <p>For example, consider a situation in which a social Web site embeds in one <code>iframe</code>
  the user's e-mail contacts provider (an address book site, from a second origin), and in a second
  <code>iframe</code> a game (from a third origin). The outer social site and the game in the second
  <code>iframe</code> cannot access anything inside the first <code>iframe</code>; together they can
  only:</p>

  <ul class="brief">

   <li><span>Navigate</span> the <code>iframe</code> to a new <span>URL</span>, such as the same
   <span>URL</span> but with a different <span data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span>,
   causing the <code>Window</code> in the <code>iframe</code> to receive a <code
   data-x="event-hashchange">hashchange</code> event.</li>

   <li>Resize the <code>iframe</code>, causing the <code>Window</code> in the <code>iframe</code> to
   receive a <code data-x="event-resize">resize</code> event.</li>

   <!-- anything else? -->

   <li>Send a <code data-x="event-message">message</code> event to the <code>Window</code> in the
   <code>iframe</code> using the <code data-x="dom-window-postMessage">window.postMessage()</code>
   API.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The contacts provider can use these methods, most particularly the third one, to provide an API
  that can be accessed by other origins to manipulate the user's address book. For example, it could
  respond to a message "<code data-x="">add-contact Guillaume Tell
  &lt;tell@pomme.example.net></code>" by adding the given person and e-mail address to the user's
  address book.</p>

  <p>To avoid any site on the Web being able to manipulate the user's contacts, the contacts
  provider might only allow certain trusted sites, such as the social site, to do this.</p>

  <p>Now suppose the game wanted to add a contact to the user's address book, and that the social
  site was willing to allow it to do so on its behalf, essentially "sharing" the trust that the
  contacts provider had with the social site. There are several ways it could do this; most simply,
  it could just proxy messages between the game site and the contacts site. However, this solution
  has a number of difficulties: it requires the social site to either completely trust the game site
  not to abuse the privilege, or it requires that the social site verify each request to make sure
  it's not a request that it doesn't want to allow (such as adding multiple contacts, reading the
  contacts, or deleting them); it also requires some additional complexity if there's ever the
  possibility of multiple games simultaneously trying to interact with the contacts provider.</p>

  <p>Using message channels and <code>MessagePort</code> objects, however, all of these problems can
  go away. When the game tells the social site that it wants to add a contact, the social site can
  ask the contacts provider not for it to add a contact, but for the <em>capability</em> to add a
  single contact. The contacts provider then creates a pair of <code>MessagePort</code> objects, and
  sends one of them back to the social site, who forwards it on to the game. The game and the
  contacts provider then have a direct connection, and the contacts provider knows to only honor a
  single "add contact" request, nothing else. In other words, the game has been granted the
  capability to add a single contact.</p>
