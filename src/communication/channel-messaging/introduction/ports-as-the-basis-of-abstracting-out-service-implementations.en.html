<h5>Ports as the basis of abstracting out service implementations</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Continuing the example from the previous section, consider the contacts provider in particular.
  While an initial implementation might have simply used <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> objects in the
  service's <code>iframe</code>, an evolution of the service might instead want to use a <span
  data-x="SharedWorker">shared worker</span> with a single <code>WebSocket</code> connection.</p>

  <p>If the initial design used <code>MessagePort</code> objects to grant capabilities, or even just
  to allow multiple simultaneous independent sessions, the service implementation can switch from
  the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>s-in-each-<code>iframe</code> model to the
  shared-<code>WebSocket</code> model without changing the API at all: the ports on the service
  provider side can all be forwarded to the shared worker without it affecting the users of the API
  in the slightest.</p>
