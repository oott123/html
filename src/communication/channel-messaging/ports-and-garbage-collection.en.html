  <div w-nodev>

  <p>When a <code>MessagePort</code> object <var>o</var> is entangled, user agents must
  either act as if <var>o</var>'s entangled <code>MessagePort</code> object has a strong
  reference to <var>o</var>, or as if the <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global
  object</span> specified by <var>o</var>'s <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span> has a
  strong reference to <var>o</var>.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>Thus, a message port can be received, given an event listener, and then forgotten, and so long
   as that event listener could receive a message, the channel will be maintained.</p>

   <p>Of course, if this was to occur on both sides of the channel, then both ports could be garbage
   collected, since they would not be reachable from live code, despite having a strong reference to
   each other.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Furthermore, a <code>MessagePort</code> object must not be garbage collected while there exists
  an event referenced by a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> in a <span>task queue</span> that is to be dispatched on that <code>MessagePort</code>
  object, or while the <code>MessagePort</code> object's <span>port message queue</span> is enabled
  and not empty.</p> <!-- we
  might not need to explicitly say the first part if UI Events is fixed to say that events on a
  task queue prevent GC -->

  <!-- ports in the ports attribute of a MessageEvent that isn't dispatched yet are safe because the
  MessageEvent is safe -->

  </div>

  <p class="note">Authors are strongly encouraged to explicitly close <code>MessagePort</code>
  objects to disentangle them, so that their resources can be recollected. Creating many
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects and discarding them without closing them can lead to high
  transient memory usage since garbage collection is not necessarily performed promptly, especially
  for <code>MessagePort</code>s where garbage collection can involve cross-process coordination.</p>
