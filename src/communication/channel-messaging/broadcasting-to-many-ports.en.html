<h4>Broadcasting to many ports</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Broadcasting to many ports is in principle relatively simple: keep an array of
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects to send messages to, and iterate through the array to send a
  message. However, this has one rather unfortunate effect: it prevents the ports from being garbage
  collected, even if the other side has gone away. To avoid this problem, implement a simple
  protocol whereby the other side acknowledges it still exists. If it doesn't do so after a certain
  amount of time, assume it's gone, close the <code>MessagePort</code> object, and let it be garbage
  collected.</p>
