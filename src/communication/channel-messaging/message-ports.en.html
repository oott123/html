  <h4>Message ports</h4>

  <p>Each channel has two message ports. Data sent through one port is received by the other port,
  and vice versa.</p>

  <p>Each <code>MessagePort</code> object can be entangled with another (a symmetric relationship).
  Each <code>MessagePort</code> object also has a <span>task source</span> called the <dfn>port
  message queue</dfn>, initially empty. A <span>port message queue</span> can be enabled or
  disabled, and is initially disabled. Once enabled, a port can never be disabled again (though
  messages in the queue can get moved to another queue or removed altogether, which has much the
  same effect). A <code>MessagePort</code> also has a <dfn>has been shipped</dfn> flag, which must
  initially be false, and an <dfn data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</dfn>, which is a <span>settings
  object</span> set when the object is created, as described below.</p>

  <p>When a port's <span>port message queue</span> is enabled, the <span>event loop</span> must use
  it as one of its <span data-x="task source">task sources</span>. When a port's <span
  data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span> specifies a <span>responsible event loop</span> that is a
  <span>browsing context</span> <span>event loop</span>, all <span
  data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> <span data-x="queue a task">queued</span> on its <span>port
  message queue</span> must be associated with the <span>responsible document</span> specified by
  the port's <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">If the port's <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span> specifies a
  <span>responsible document</span> that is <span>fully active</span>, but the event listeners all
  have scripts whose <span data-x="settings object">settings objects</span> specify <span
  data-x="responsible document">responsible documents</span> that are <em>not</em> <span>fully
  active</span>, then the messages will be lost.</p> <!-- because of the jump-to-entry-point
  algorithm first step -->

  <p>Each <span>event loop</span> has a <span>task source</span> called the <dfn>unshipped port
  message queue</dfn>. This is a virtual <span>task source</span>: it must act as if it contained
  the <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> of each <span>port message queue</span> of each
  <code>MessagePort</code> whose <span>has been shipped</span> flag is false, whose <span>port
  message queue</span> is enabled, and whose <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span>
  specifies that <span>event loop</span> as the <span>responsible event loop</span>, in the order in
  which they were added to their respective <span>task source</span>. When a <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span> would be removed from the <span>unshipped port message
  queue</span>, it must instead be removed from its <span>port message queue</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <code>MessagePort</code>'s <span>has been shipped</span> flag is false, its <span>port
  message queue</span> must be ignored for the purposes of the <span>event loop</span>. (The
  <span>unshipped port message queue</span> is used instead.)</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>has been shipped</span> flag is set to true when a port, its twin, or
  the object it was cloned from, is or has been transferred. When a <code>MessagePort</code>'s
  <span>has been shipped</span> flag is true, its <span>port message queue</span> acts as a
  first-class <span>task source</span>, unaffected to any <span>unshipped port message
  queue</span>.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>create a new <code>MessagePort</code> object</dfn> with a
  particular <span>environment settings object</span> as its <var>owner</var>, it must instantiate
  a new <code>MessagePort</code> object, and let its <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span>
  be <var>owner</var>.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>entangle</dfn> two <code>MessagePort</code> objects, it must run
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If one of the ports is already entangled, then disentangle it and the port that it was
    entangled with.</p>

    <p class="note">If those two previously entangled ports were the two ports of a
    <code>MessageChannel</code> object, then that <code>MessageChannel</code> object no longer
    represents an actual channel: the two ports in that object are no longer entangled.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Associate the two ports to be entangled, so that they form the two parts of a new channel.
    (There is no <code>MessageChannel</code> object that represents this channel.)</p>

    <p>Two ports <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> that have gone through this step
    are now said to be entangled; one is entangled to the other, and vice versa.</p>

    <p class="note">While this specification describes this process as instantaneous,
    implementations are more likely to implement it via message passing. As with all algorithms, the
    key is "merely" that the end result be indistinguishable, in a black-box sense, from the
    specification.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p id="transferMessagePort"><code>MessagePort</code> objects are <span>transferable
  objects</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <code>MessagePort</code> object's [[<span>Transfer</span>]] internal method, given a
  <var>targetRealm</var>, must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set <b>this</b>'s <span>has been shipped</span> flag to true.</p></li>

   <var>new</var>'s <span>port message queue</span> in its initial disabled state, and, if

   event loop</span> that is a <span>browsing context</span> <span>event loop</span>, associating
   the moved <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> with the <span>responsible document</span>
   specified by <var>new</var>'s <span data-x="concept-port-owner">owner</span>.</p></li>

    called.)</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>If any of the objects in <var>transfer</var> are this <code>MessagePort</code>, then throw

  across multiple tabs) to gracefully handle a catastrophic failure in one process. A strictly
