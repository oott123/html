  <H4>Authoring notes</h4>

  <p>Legacy proxy servers are known to, in certain cases, drop HTTP connections after a short
  timeout. To protect against such proxy servers, authors can include a comment line (one starting
  with a ':' character) every 15 seconds or so.</p>

  <p>Authors wishing to relate event source connections to each other or to specific documents
  previously served might find that relying on IP addresses doesn't work, as individual clients can
  have multiple IP addresses (due to having multiple proxy servers) and individual IP addresses can
  have multiple clients (due to sharing a proxy server). It is better to include a unique identifier
  in the document when it is served and then pass that identifier as part of the URL when the
  connection is established.</p>

  <p>Authors are also cautioned that HTTP chunking can have unexpected negative effects on the
  reliability of this protocol, in particular if the chunking is done by a different layer unaware
  of the timing requirements. If this is a problem, chunking can be disabled for serving event
  streams.</p> <!-- v2 can we get a better solution? -->

  <p>Clients that support HTTP's per-server connection limitation might run into trouble when
  opening multiple pages from a site if each page has an <code>EventSource</code> to the same
  domain. Authors can avoid this using the relatively complex mechanism of using unique domain names
  per connection, or by allowing the user to enable or disable the <code>EventSource</code>
  functionality on a per-page basis, or by sharing a single <code>EventSource</code> object using a
