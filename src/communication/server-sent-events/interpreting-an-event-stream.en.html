<h4 id="event-stream-interpretation">Interpreting an event stream</h4>

  <p>Streams must be decoded using the <span>UTF-8 decode</span> algorithm.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>UTF-8 decode</span> algorithm strips one leading UTF-8 Byte Order Mark
  (BOM), if any.</p>

  <p>The stream must then be parsed by reading everything line by line, with a U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character not
  preceded by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character, and a single U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
  character not followed by a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character being the ways in which a line can
  end.</p>

  <p>When a stream is parsed, a <var>data</var> buffer, an <var>event type</var>
  buffer, and a <var>last event ID</var> buffer must be associated with it. They must be
  initialized to the empty string</p>

  <p>Lines must be processed, in the order they are received, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the line is empty (a blank line)</dt>

   <dd><p><span>Dispatch the event</span>, as defined below.</p></dd>


   <dt>If the line starts with a U+003A COLON character (:)</dt>

   <dd><p>Ignore the line.</p></dd>


   <dt>If the line contains a U+003A COLON character (:)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Collect the characters on the line before the first U+003A COLON character (:), and let <var>field</var> be that string.</p>

    <p>Collect the characters on the line after the first U+003A COLON character (:), and let <var>value</var> be that string. If <var>value</var> starts with a U+0020 SPACE
    character, remove it from <var>value</var>.</p>

    <p><a href="#processField">Process the field</a> using the steps described below, using <var>field</var> as the field name and <var>value</var> as the field value.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Otherwise, the string is not empty but does not contain a U+003A COLON character (:)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p><a href="#processField">Process the field</a> using the steps described below, using the
    whole line as the field name, and the empty string as the field value.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Once the end of the file is reached, any pending data must be discarded. (If the file ends in
  the middle of an event, before the final empty line, the incomplete event is not dispatched.)</p>

  <hr>

  <p id="processField">The steps to <dfn data-x="">process the field</dfn> given a field name and a
  field value depend on the field name, as given in the following list. Field names must be compared
  literally, with no case folding performed.</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the field name is "event"</dt>

   <dd><p>Set the <var>event type</var> buffer to field value.</p></dd>


   <dt>If the field name is "data"</dt>

   <dd><p>Append the field value to the <var>data</var> buffer, then append a single U+000A
   LINE FEED (LF) character to the <var>data</var> buffer.</p></dd>


   <dt>If the field name is "id"</dt>

   <dd><p>Set the <var>last event ID</var> buffer to the field value.</p></dd>


   <dt>If the field name is "retry"</dt>

   <dd><p>If the field value consists of only <span>ASCII digits</span>, then interpret the field
   value as an integer in base ten, and set the event stream's <span
   data-x="concept-event-stream-reconnection-time">reconnection time</span> to that integer.
   Otherwise, ignore the field.</p></dd>

   <dt>If the field name is "reconnect"</dt>

   <dd><p>If the field value is the empty string, then: <span>dispatch the
   event</span> as defined below, and then drop the connection and immediately reconnect as if the

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn id="dispatchMessage">dispatch the
  event</dfn>, the user agent must process the <var>data</var> buffer, the <var>event type</var> buffer, and the <var>last event ID</var> buffer using steps
  appropriate for the user agent.</p>

  <p>For Web browsers, the appropriate steps to <span>dispatch the event</span> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set the <span data-x="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event ID string</span> of
   the event source to the value of the <var>last event ID</var> buffer. The buffer does
   not get reset, so the <span data-x="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event ID
   string</span> of the event source remains set to this value until the next time it is set by the
   server.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>data</var> buffer is an empty string, set the <var>data</var> buffer and the <var>event type</var> buffer to the empty string and
   abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>data</var> buffer's last character is a U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   character, then remove the last character from the <var>data</var> buffer.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>event</var> be the result of <span>creating an event</span> using
   <code>MessageEvent</code>, in the <span data-x="concept-relevant-realm">relevant Realm</span> of
   the <code>EventSource</code> object.</p></li>

   <li><p>Initialize <var>event</var>'s <code data-x="dom-Event-type">type</code> attribute to <code
   data-x="event-message">message</code>, its <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code>
   attribute to <var>data</var>, its <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</code> attribute
   to the <span data-x="Unicode serialization of an origin">Unicode serialization</span>
   of the <span>origin</span> of the event stream's final URL (i.e. the URL after redirects), and
   its <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId">lastEventId</code> attribute to the <span
   data-x="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event ID string</span> of the event
   source.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>event type</var> buffer has a value other than the empty string, change the
   <span data-x="concept-event-type">type</span> of the newly created event to equal the value of
   the <var>event type</var> buffer.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <var>data</var> buffer and the <var>event type</var> buffer to
   the empty string.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> which, if the <code
   data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is set to a value other than <code
   data-x="dom-EventSource-CLOSED">CLOSED</code>, <span
   data-x="concept-event-dispatch">dispatches</span> the newly created event at the
   <code>EventSource</code> object.</p></li> <!-- so calling close() drops the messages immediately.
   The connection dying doesn't interfere with already-sent messages since it sets us to CLOSED via
   a task, not immediately -->

  </ol>

  <p class="note">If an event doesn't have an "id" field, but an earlier event did set the event
  source's <span data-x="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event ID string</span>, then the
  event's <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId">lastEventId</code> field will be set to the
  value of whatever the last seen "id" field was.</p>

  <p>For other user agents, the appropriate steps to <span>dispatch the event</span> are
  implementation dependent, but at a minimum they must set the <var>data</var> and <var>event type</var> buffers to the empty string before returning.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following event stream, once followed by a blank line:</p>
   <pre>data: YHOO
data: +2
data: 10</pre>

   <p>...would cause an event <code data-x="event-message">message</code> with the interface
   <code>MessageEvent</code> to be dispatched on the <code>EventSource</code> object. The event's
   <code data-x="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code> attribute would contain the string "<code
   data-x="">YHOO\n+2\n10</code>" (where "<code data-x="">\n</code>" represents a newline).</p>

   <p>This could be used as follows:
   <pre>var stocks = new EventSource("https://stocks.example.com/ticker.php");
stocks.onmessage = function (event) {
  var data = event.data.split('\n');
  updateStocks(data[0], data[1], data[2]);
};</pre>

   <p>...where <code data-x="">updateStocks()</code> is a function defined as:</p>

   <pre>function updateStocks(symbol, delta, value) { ... }</pre>

   <p>...or some such.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream contains four blocks. The first block has just a comment, and will fire
   nothing. The second block has two fields with names "data" and "id" respectively; an event will
   be fired for this block, with the data "first event", and will then set the last event ID to "1"
   so that if the connection died between this block and the next, the server would be sent a `<code
   data-x="http-last-event-id">Last-Event-ID</code>` header with the value "1". The third block
   fires an event with data "second event", and also has an "id" field, this time with no value,
   which resets the last event ID to the empty string (meaning no `<code
   data-x="http-last-event-id">Last-Event-ID</code>` header will now be sent in the event of a
   reconnection being attempted). Finally, the last block just fires an event with the data
   "&nbsp;third&nbsp;event" (with a single leading space character). Note that the last still has to
   end with a blank line, the end of the stream is not enough to trigger the dispatch of the last
   event.</p>

   <pre>: test stream

data: first event
id: 1

data:second event
id

data:&nbsp;&nbsp;third event
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream fires two events:</p>

   <pre>data

data
data

data:</pre>

   <p>The first block fires events with the data set to the empty string, as would the last block if
   it was followed by a blank line. The middle block fires an event with the data set to a single
   newline character. The last block is discarded because it is not followed by a blank line.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream fires two identical events:</p>

   <pre>data:test

data:&nbsp;test
</pre>

   <p>This is because the space after the colon is ignored if present.</p>

  </div>
