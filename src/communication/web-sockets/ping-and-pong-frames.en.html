  <h4>Ping and Pong frames</h4>

  <p>The WebSocket protocol specification defines Ping and Pong frames that can be used for
  keep-alive, heart-beats, network status probing, latency instrumentation, and so forth. These are
  not currently exposed in the API.</p>

  <p>User agents may send ping and unsolicited pong frames as desired, for example in an attempt to
  maintain local network NAT mappings, to detect failed connections, or to display latency metrics
  to the user. User agents must not use pings or unsolicited pongs to aid the server; it is assumed
  that servers will solicit pongs whenever appropriate for the server's needs.</p>

  <!-- v2: we'll probably add a way to make the client send pings and automatically terminate the
  connection if they don't get a pong within an author-provided timeout; see
  https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=17264 -->
