  <h4>The microdata model</h4>

  <p>The microdata model consists of groups of name-value pairs known as <span
  data-x="concept-item">items</span>.</p>

  <p>Each group is known as an <span data-x="concept-item">item</span>. Each <span
  data-x="concept-item">item</span> can have <span>item types</span>, a <span>global
  identifier</span> (if the vocabulary specified by the <span>item types</span> <span>support global
  identifiers for items</span>), and a list of name-value pairs. Each name in the name-value pair is
  known as a <span data-x="the properties of an item">property</span>, and each <span data-x="the
  properties of an item">property</span> has one or more <span
  data-x="concept-property-value">values</span>. Each <span
  data-x="concept-property-value">value</span> is either a string or itself a group of name-value
  pairs (an <span data-x="concept-item">item</span>). The names are unordered relative to each other,
  but if a particular name has multiple values, they do have a relative order.</p>
