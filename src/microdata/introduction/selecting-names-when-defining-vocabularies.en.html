  <h4>Selecting names when defining vocabularies</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Using microdata means using a vocabulary. For some purposes, an ad-hoc vocabulary is adequate.
  For others, a vocabulary will need to be designed. Where possible, authors are encouraged to
  re-use existing vocabularies, as this makes content re-use easier.</p>

  <p>When designing new vocabularies, identifiers can be created either using <span
  data-x="URL">URLs</span>, or, for properties, as plain words (with no dots or colons). For URLs,
  conflicts with other vocabularies can be avoided by only using identifiers that correspond to
  pages that the author has control over.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For instance, if Jon and Adam both write content at <code
   data-x="">example.com</code>, at <code
   data-x="">https://example.com/~jon/...</code> and <code
   data-x="">https://example.com/~adam/...</code> respectively, then
   they could select identifiers of the form
   "https://example.com/~jon/name" and "https://example.com/~adam/name"
   respectively.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Properties whose names are just plain words can only be used within the context of the types
  for which they are intended; properties named using URLs can be reused in items of any type. If an
  item has no type, and is not part of another item, then if its properties have names that are just
  plain words, they are not intended to be globally unique, and are instead only intended for
  limited use. Generally speaking, authors are encouraged to use either properties with globally
  unique names (URLs) or ensure that their items are typed.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, an item is an "https://example.org/animals#cat", and most of the properties have names
   that are words defined in the context of that type. There are also a few additional properties
   whose names come from other vocabularies.</p>

<pre>&lt;section itemscope itemtype="https://example.org/animals#cat">
 &lt;h1 itemprop="name https://example.com/fn">Hedral&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p itemprop="desc">Hedral is a male american domestic
 shorthair, with a fluffy &lt;span
 itemprop="https://example.com/color">black&lt;/span> fur with &lt;span
 itemprop="https://example.com/color">white&lt;/span> paws and belly.&lt;/p>
 &lt;img itemprop="img" src="hedral.jpeg" alt="" title="Hedral, age 18 months">
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>This example has one item with the type "https://example.org/animals#cat" and the following
   properties:</p>

   <table>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <td>Property
      <td>Value
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>name
      <td>Hedral
     <tr>
      <td>https://example.com/fn
      <td>Hedral
     <tr>
      <td>desc
      <td>Hedral is a male american domestic shorthair, with a fluffy black fur with white paws and belly.
     <tr>
      <td>https://example.com/color
      <td>black
     <tr>
      <td>https://example.com/color
      <td>white
     <tr>
      <td>img
      <td>.../hedral.jpeg
   </table>
