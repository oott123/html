<h6 id="sample-handler-impl">Sample user interface</h6>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>A simple implementation of this feature for a desktop Web browser might work as follows.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code> method
  could display a modal dialog box:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/sample-content-handler-registration.png" width="534" height="374" alt="The modal dialog box could have the title 'Content Handler Registration', and could say 'This Web page: Kittens at work http://kittens.example.org/ ...would like permission to handle files of type: application/x-meowmeow using the following Web-based application: Kittens-at-work displayer http://kittens.example.org/?show=%s Do you trust the administrators of the &quot;kittens.example.org&quot; domain?' with two buttons, 'Trust kittens.example.org' and 'Cancel'."></p>

  <p>In this dialog box, "Kittens at work" is the title of the page that invoked the method,
  "http://kittens.example.org/" is the URL of that page, "application/x-meowmeow" is the string that
  was passed to the <code
  data-x="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code> method as its first
  argument (<var>mimeType</var>), "http://kittens.example.org/?show=%s" was the second
  argument (<var>url</var>), and "Kittens-at-work displayer" was the third argument (<var>title</var>).</p>

  <p>If the user clicks the Cancel button, then nothing further happens. If the user clicks the
  "Trust" button, then the handler is remembered.</p>

  <p>When the user then attempts to fetch a URL that uses the "application/x-meowmeow" <span>MIME
  type</span>, then it might display a dialog as follows:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/sample-content-handler.png" width="577" height="428" alt="The dialog box could have the title 'Unknown File Type' and could say 'You have attempted to access:' followed by a URL, followed by a prompt such as 'How would you like FerretBrowser to handle this resource?' with three radio buttons, one saying 'Contact the FerretBrowser plugin registry to see if there is an official way to handle this resource.', one saying 'Pass this URL to a local application' with an application selector, and one saying 'Pass this URL to the &quot;Kittens-at-work displayer&quot; application at &quot;kittens.example.org&quot;', with a checkbox labeled 'Always do this for resources using the &quot;application/x-meowmeow&quot; type in future.', and with two buttons, 'Ok' and 'Cancel'."></p>

  <p>In this dialog, the third option is the one that was primed by the site registering itself
  earlier.</p>

  <p>If the user does select that option, then the browser, in accordance with the requirements
  described in the previous two sections, will redirect the user to
  "http://kittens.example.org/?show=data%3Aapplication/x-meowmeow;base64,S2l0dGVucyBhcmUgdGhlIGN1dGVzdCE%253D".</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code> method
  would work equivalently, but for schemes instead of unknown content types.</p>
