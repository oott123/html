  <h6>Security and privacy</h6>

  <p>These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in particular privacy concerns.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not allow schemes that are key to
  its normal operation, such as an <span>HTTP(S) scheme</span>, to be rerouted through third-party
  sites. This would allow a user's activities to be trivially tracked, and would allow user
  information, even in secure connections, to be collected.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> User agents are strongly urged to not automatically change
  any defaults, as this could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is not
  expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never automatically cause those sites to be
  used.</p>

  <p><strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should consider the possibility that a site
  will attempt to register a large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g. by
  redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain, and each registering a handler
  for <code>video/mpeg</code> &mdash; analogous practices abusing other Web browser features have
  been used by pornography Web sites for many years). User agents should gracefully handle such
  hostile attempts, protecting the user.</p>

  <p><strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely wholly on the <var>title</var>
  argument to the methods when presenting the registered handlers to the user, since sites could
  easily lie. For example, a site <code data-x="">hostile.example.net</code> could claim that it was
  registering the "Cuddly Bear Happy Content Handler". User agents should therefore use the
  handler's domain in any UI along with any title.</p>

  <p><strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should protect against typical attacks
  against strings embedded in their interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters
  in such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled, that over-long strings do
  not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and so forth.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking Intranet URLs.</strong> The mechanism described in this section can result in
  secret Intranet URLs being leaked, in the following manner:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default handler for a content
   type.</li>

   <li>The user then browses their corporate Intranet site and accesses a document that uses that
   content type.</li>

   <li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third party the URL to the Intranet
   content.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but the URLs themselves could
  contain confidential information. For example, the URL could be <code
  data-x="">https://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/the-sample-company.egf</code>, which
  might tell the third party that Example Corporation is intending to merge with The Sample Company.
  Implementors might wish to consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for certain
  subdomains, content types, or schemes.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking secure URLs.</strong> User agents should not send HTTPS URLs to third-party
  sites registered as content handlers without the user's informed consent, for the same reason that
  user agents sometimes avoid sending `<code data-x="http-referer">Referer</code>` (sic) HTTP
  headers from secure sites to third-party sites.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send username or password
  information in the URLs that are escaped and included sent to the handler sites. User agents may
  even avoid attempting to pass to Web-based handlers the URLs of resources that are known to
  require authentication to access, as such sites would be unable to access the resources in
  question without prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would require the
  user to know whether to trust the third-party handler, a decision many users are unable to make or
  even understand).</p>

  <p><strong>Interface interference.</strong> User agents should be prepared to handle intentionally
  long arguments to the methods. For example, if the user interface exposed consists of an "accept"
  button and a "deny" button, with the "accept" binding containing the name of the handler, it's
  important that a long name not cause the "deny" button to be pushed off the screen.</p>

  <p><strong>Fingerprinting users.</strong> Since a site can detect if it has attempted to register
  a particular handler or not, whether or not the user responds, the mechanism can be used to store
  data. User agents are therefore strongly urged to treat registrations in the same manner as
  cookies: clearing cookies for a site should also clear all registrations for that site, and
  disabling cookies for a site should also disable registrations.</p>
