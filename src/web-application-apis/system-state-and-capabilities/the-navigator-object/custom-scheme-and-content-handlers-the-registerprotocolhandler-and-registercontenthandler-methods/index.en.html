  <p>The <dfn><code
  data-x="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code></dfn> method
  allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for particular schemes. For example,
  an online telephone messaging service could register itself as a handler of the <code data-x="sms
  protocol">sms:</code> scheme, so that if the user clicks on such a link, they are given the
  opportunity to use that Web site. Analogously, the <dfn><code
  data-x="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code></dfn> method allows
  Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for content in a particular <span>MIME
  type</span>. For example, the same online telephone messaging service could register itself as a
  handler for <code>text/vcard</code> files, so that if the user has no native application capable
  of handling vCards, their Web browser can instead suggest they use that site to view contact
  information stored on vCards that they open. <ref spec=SMS> <ref spec=RFC6350></p>

  <p>User agents may, within the constraints described in this section, do whatever they like when
  the methods are called. A UA could, for instance, prompt the user and offer the user the
  opportunity to add the site to a shortlist of handlers, or make the handlers their default, or
  cancel the request. UAs could provide such a UI through modal UI or through a non-modal transient
  notification interface. UAs could also simply silently collect the information, providing it only
  when relevant to the user.</p>

  <p>User agents should keep track of which sites have registered handlers (even if the user has
  declined such registrations) so that the user is not repeatedly prompted with the same
  request.</p>

  <p>The arguments to the methods have the following meanings and corresponding implementation
  requirements. The requirements that involve throwing exceptions must be processed in the order
  given below, stopping at the first exception thrown. (So the exceptions for the first argument
  take precedence over the exceptions for the second argument.)</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><var>scheme</var> (<code data-x="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code> only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A scheme, such as "<code data-x="">mailto</code>" or "<code data-x="">web+auth</code>". The
    scheme must be compared in an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner by user agents for the
    purposes of comparing with the scheme part of URLs that they consider against the list of
    registered handlers.</p>

    <p>The <var>scheme</var> value, if it contains a colon (as in "<code data-x="">mailto:</code>"),
    will never match anything, since schemes don't contain colons.</p>

    <p>If the <code data-x="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code>
    method is invoked with a scheme that is neither a <span>safelisted scheme</span> nor a scheme
    whose value starts with the substring "<code data-x="">web+</code>" and otherwise contains only
    <span>lowercase ASCII letters</span>, and whose length is at least five characters (including
    the "<code data-x="">web+</code>" prefix), the user agent must throw a
    <span>"<code>SecurityError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>.</p>

    <p>The following schemes are the <dfn data-x="safelisted scheme">safelisted schemes</dfn>:</p>

    <p class="note">This list excludes any schemes that could reasonably be expected to be supported
    inline, e.g. in an <code>iframe</code>, such as <code data-x="">http</code> or (more
    theoretically) <code data-x="">gopher</code>. If those were supported, they could potentially be
    used in man-in-the-middle attacks, by replacing pages that have frames with such content with
    content under the control of the protocol handler. If the user agent has native support for the
    schemes, this could further be used for cookie-theft attacks.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>mimeType</var> (<code data-x="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code> only)</dt>

    <p>A <span>MIME type</span>, such as <code data-x="">model/vnd.flatland.3dml</code> or <code
    data-x="">application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</code>. The <span>MIME type</span> must be
    compared in an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner by user agents for the purposes of
    comparing with MIME types of documents that they consider against the list of registered
    handlers.</p>

    <p>User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME type/subtype parts of content
    types, not to the complete type including parameters. Thus, if <var>mimeType</var>
    values passed to this method include characters such as commas or whitespace, or include MIME
    parameters, then the handler being registered will never be used.</p>

    <p class="note">The type is compared to the <span>MIME type</span> used by the user agent
    <em>after</em> the sniffing algorithms have been applied.</p>

    <p>If the <code data-x="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code>
    method is invoked with a <span>MIME type</span> that is in the <span>type blocklist</span> or

   <dt><var>url</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A string used to build the <span>URL</span> of the page that will handle the requests.</p>

    <p>User agents must throw a <span>"<code>SyntaxError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code> if
    the <var>url</var> argument passed to one of these methods does not contain the exact literal
    string "<code data-x="">%s</code>".</p>

    <span data-x="parse a url">parsing</span> the <var>url</var> argument relative to the
    <span>relevant settings object</span> of this <code>NavigatorContentUtils</code> object is not
    successful.</p>

    <p class="note">The <span>resulting URL string</span> would by definition not be a <span>valid
    URL</span> as it would include the string "<code data-x="">%s</code>" which is not a valid
    component in a URL.</p>

    <p>User agents must throw a <span>"<code>SecurityError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>
    if the <span>resulting URL record</span> has an <span data-x="concept-url-origin">origin</span>
    that differs from the <span data-x="concept-settings-object-origin">origin</span> specified by
    the <span>relevant settings object</span> of this <code>NavigatorContentUtils</code> object.</p>

    <p class="note">This is forcibly the case if the <code data-x="">%s</code> placeholder is in the
    scheme, host, or port parts of the URL.</p>

    <p>The <span>resulting URL string</span> is the <dfn>proto-URL</dfn>. It identifies the
    handler for the purposes of the methods described below.</p>

    <p>When the user agent uses this handler, it must replace the first occurrence of the exact
    literal string "<code data-x="">%s</code>" in the <var>url</var> argument with an
    escaped version of the <span>absolute URL</span> of the content in question (as defined below),
    then <span data-x="parse a url">parse</span> the resulting URL, relative to the <span>relevant

    data-x="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code> method was
    invoked, and then <span>navigate</span><!--DONAV user--> an appropriate <span>browsing
    context</span> to the resulting URL.</p>

    <p>To get the escaped version of the <span>absolute URL</span> of the content in question, the
    user agent must replace every character in that <span>absolute URL</span> that is not a
    character in the URL <span>default encode set</span> with the result of <span data-x="UTF-8
    percent encode">UTF-8 percent encoding</span> that character.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the user had visited a site at <code data-x="">https://example.com/</code> that made the
     following call:</p>

     <pre>navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb&trade;')</pre>

     <p>...and then, much later, while visiting <code data-x="">https://www.example.net/</code>,
     clicked on a link such as:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup">Download our Chicken K&#xEF;wi soup!&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>...then, assuming this <code data-x="">chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code> file was served with the
     <span>MIME type</span> <code data-x="">application/x-soup</code>, the UA might navigate to the
     following URL:</p>

     <pre>https://example.com/soup?url=https://www.example.net/chickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

     <p>This site could then fetch the <code data-x="">chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code> file and do
     whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesize it and ship it to the user, or whatever).</p>

    <p>A descriptive title of the handler, which the UA might use to remind the user what the site

  </dl>

  <p>This section does not define how the pages registered by these methods are used, beyond the
  requirements on how to process the <var>url</var> value (see above). To some extent, the
  <span data-x="navigate">processing model for navigating across documents</span> defines some cases
  where these methods are relevant, but in general UAs may use this information wherever they would
  otherwise consider handing content to native plugins or helper applications.</p>

  <p>UAs must not use registered content handlers to handle content that was returned as part of a
  non-GET transaction (or rather, as part of any non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site
  would not be able to fetch the same data.</p>
