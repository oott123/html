  <h6>Entry</h6>

  <p>All <span data-x="realm execution context">realm execution contexts</span> must contain, as
  part of their code evaluation state, an <dfn>entrance counter</dfn> value, which is initially
  zero. In the process of <a href="#calling-scripts">calling scripts</a>, this value will be
  incremented and decremented.</p>

  <p>With this in hand, we define the <dfn>entry execution context</dfn> to be the most recently
  pushed entry in the <span>JavaScript execution context stack</span> whose <span>entrance
  counter</span> value is greater than zero. The <dfn data-x="concept-entry-realm">entry Realm</dfn>
  is the <span>entry execution context</span>'s Realm component.</p>

  <p>Then, the <dfn>entry settings object</dfn> is the <span
  data-x="concept-realm-settings-object">environment settings object</span> of the <span
  data-x="concept-entry-realm">entry Realm</span>.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the <dfn>entry global object</dfn> is the <span
  data-x="concept-realm-global">global object</span> of the <span data-x="concept-entry-realm">entry
  Realm</span>.</p>
