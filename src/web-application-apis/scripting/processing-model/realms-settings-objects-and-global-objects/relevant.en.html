  <h6>Relevant</h6>

  <p>The <dfn data-export="">relevant settings object</dfn> for a <span>platform object</span> is
  defined as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">
   <dt>If the object is a <span>global object</span></dt>
   <dd>Each <span>global object</span> in this specification is created alongside a corresponding
   <span>environment settings object</span>; that is its <span>relevant settings object</span>.</dd>

   <dt>Otherwise</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>The <span>relevant settings object</span> for a non-global <span>platform object</span>
    <var>o</var> is the <span>environment settings object</span> whose <span
    data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> is the global object of the
    <span>global environment associated with</span> <var>o</var>.</p>

    <p class="note">The "<span>global environment associated with</span>" concept is from the olden
    days, before the modern JavaScript specification and its concept of <span data-x="JavaScript
    realm">realms</span>. We expect that as the Web IDL specification gets updated, every
    <span>platform object</span> will have a <span data-x="JavaScript realm">Realm</span> associated
    with it, and this definition can be re-cast in those terms. <ref spec=JAVASCRIPT> <ref
    spec=WEBIDL></p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Then, the <dfn data-export="" data-x="concept-relevant-realm">relevant Realm</dfn> for a
  <span>platform object</span> is the <span data-x="environment settings object's
  Realm">Realm</span> of its <span>relevant settings object</span>.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the <dfn data-export="" data-x="concept-relevant-global">relevant global
  object</dfn> for a <span>platform object</span> is the <span
  data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> of its <span>relevant settings
  object</span>.</p>
