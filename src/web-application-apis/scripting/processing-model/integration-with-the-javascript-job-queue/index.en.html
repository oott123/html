  <h5>Integration with the JavaScript job queue</h5>

  <p>The JavaScript specification defines the JavaScript job and job queue abstractions in order to
  specify certain invariants about how promise operations execute with a clean <span>JavaScript
  execution context stack</span> and in a certain order. However, as of the time of this writing
  the definition of <span data-x="js-EnqueueJob">EnqueueJob</span> in that specification is not
  sufficiently flexible to integrate with HTML as a host environment. <ref spec=JAVASCRIPT></p>

  <p class="note">This is not strictly true. It is in fact possible, by taking liberal advantage of
  the many "implementation defined" sections of the algorithm, to contort it to our purposes.
  However, the end result is a mass of messy indirection and workarounds that essentially bypasses
  the job queue infrastructure entirely, albeit in a way that is technically sanctioned within the
  bounds of implementation-defined behavior. We do not take this path, and instead introduce the
  following <span>willful violation</span>.</p>

  <p>As such, user agents must instead use the following definition in place of that in the
  JavaScript specification. These ensure that the promise jobs enqueued by the JavaScript
  specification are properly integrated into the user agent's <span data-x="event loop">event
  loops</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>RunJobs</span> abstract operation from the JavaScript specification must
  not be used by user agents.</p>
