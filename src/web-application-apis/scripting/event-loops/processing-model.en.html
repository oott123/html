  <!-- EVENT LOOP -->

  <p>An <span>event loop</span> must continually run through the following steps for as long as it
  exists:</p>

  <ol>

   <!-- lots of places in the spec refer to "step 1" -->

   <li id="step1">

    <p>Select the oldest <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> on one of the <span>event
    loop</span>'s <span data-x="task queue">task queues</span>, if any, ignoring, in the case of a
    <span>browsing context</span> <span>event loop</span>, tasks whose associated
    <code>Document</code>s are not <span>fully active</span>. The user agent may pick any <span>task
    queue</span>. If there is no task to select, then jump to the <i>microtasks</i> step below.</p>

   </li>

   <!-- note: reference to 'previous step' below -->

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> to the <span
   data-x="concept-task">task</span> selected in the previous step.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Run</i>: Run the selected <span data-x="concept-task">task</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> back to
   null.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove the task that was run in the <i>run</i> step above from its <span>task
   queue</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Microtasks</i>: <span>Perform a microtask checkpoint</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><i>Update the rendering</i>: If this <span>event loop</span> is a <span>browsing
    context</span> <span>event loop</span> (as opposed to a <a href="#workers">worker</a>
    <span>event loop</span>), then run the following substeps.</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var>now</var> be the value that would be returned by the <code>Performance</code>
     object's <code data-x="dom-Performance-now">now()</code> method. <ref spec=HRT></p>

     <li>

      <p>Let <var>docs</var> be the list of <code>Document</code> objects associated with the
      <span>event loop</span> in question, sorted arbitrarily except that the following conditions
      must be met:</p>

      <ul>

       <li><p>Any <code>Document</code> <var>B</var> that is <span data-x="browsing context nested
       through">nested through</span> a <code>Document</code> <var>A</var> must be listed after
       <var>A</var> in the list.</p></li>

       <li><p>If there are two documents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> whose <span
       data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing contexts</span> are both <span data-x="nested browsing
       context">nested browsing contexts</span> and their <span data-x="browsing context
       container">browsing context containers</span> are both elements in the same
       <code>Document</code> <var>C</var>, then the order of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> in the
       list must match the relative <span>tree order</span> of their respective <span
       data-x="browsing context container">browsing context containers</span> in
       <var>C</var>.</p></li>

      </ul>

      <p>In the steps below that iterate over <var>docs</var>, each <code>Document</code> must be
      processed in the order it is found in the list.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If there are <span data-x="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing contexts</span>
      <var>B</var> that the user agent believes would not benefit from having their rendering
      updated at this time, then remove from <var>docs</var> all <code>Document</code> objects whose
      <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>'s <span>top-level browsing
      context</span> is in <var>B</var>.</p>

      <div class="note">
       <p>Whether a <span>top-level browsing context</span> would benefit from having its rendering
       updated depends on various factors, such as the update frequency. For example, if the browser
       is attempting to achieve a 60Hz refresh rate, then these steps are only necessary every 60th
       of a second (about 16.7ms). If the browser finds that a <span>top-level browsing
       context</span> is not able to sustain this rate, it might drop to a more sustainable 30Hz for
       that set of <code>Document</code>s, rather than occasionally dropping frames. (This
       specification does not mandate any particular model for when to update the rendering.)
       Similarly, if a <span>top-level browsing context</span> is in the background, the user agent
       might decide to drop that page to a much slower 4Hz, or even less.</p>

       <p>Another example of why a browser might skip updating the rendering is to ensure certain
       <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> are executed immediately after each other, with only
       <span data-x="perform a microtask checkpoint">microtask checkpoints</span> interleaved (and
       without, e.g., <span data-x="run the animation frame callbacks">animation frame
       callbacks</span> interleaved). For example, a user agent might wish to coalesce timer
       callbacks together, with no intermediate rendering updates.</p>
      </div>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If there are a <span data-x="nested browsing context">nested browsing contexts</span>
      <var>B</var> that the user agent believes would not benefit from having their rendering
      updated at this time, then remove from <var>docs</var> all <code>Document</code> objects whose
      <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> is in <var>B</var>.</p>

      <p class="note">As with <span data-x="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing
      contexts</span>, a variety of factors can influence whether it is profitable for a browser to
      update the rendering of <span data-x="nested browsing context">nested browsing
      contexts</span>. For example, a user agent might wish to spend less resources rendering
      third-party content, especially if it is not currently visible to the user or if resources are
      constrained. In such cases, the browser could decide to update the rendering for such content
      infrequently or never.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <span>event loop</span> has a <dfn>microtask queue</dfn>. A <dfn
  data-export="">microtask</dfn> is a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that is originally to
  be queued on the <span>microtask queue</span> rather than a <span>task queue</span>. There are two
  kinds of <span data-x="microtask">microtasks</span>: <dfn data-x="solitary callback
  microtask" data-lt="solitary callback microtask" data-export="">solitary callback
  microtasks</dfn>, and <dfn data-x="compound microtask" data-lt="compound microtask"
  data-export="">compound microtasks</dfn>.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification only has <span data-x="solitary callback microtask">solitary
  callback microtasks</span>. Specifications that use <span data-x="compound microtask">compound
  microtasks</span> have to take extra care to <span data-x="execute a compound microtask
  subtask">wrap callbacks</span> to handle <span data-x="spin the event loop">spinning the event
  loop</span>.</p>

  <p>When an algorithm requires a <span>microtask</span> to be <dfn data-x="queue a
  microtask" data-lt="queue a microtask" data-export="">queued</dfn>, it must be appended to the
  relevant <span>event loop</span>'s <span>microtask queue</span>; the <span>task source</span> of
  such a <span>microtask</span> is the <dfn>microtask task source</dfn>.</p>

  <p class="note">It is possible for a <span>microtask</span> to be moved to a regular <span>task
  queue</span>, if, during its initial execution, it <span data-x="spin the event loop">spins the
  event loop</span>. In that case, the <span>microtask task source</span> is the <span>task
  source</span> used. Normally, the <span>task source</span> of a <span>microtask</span> is
  irrelevant.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn data-export="">perform a microtask checkpoint</dfn>, if the
  <span>performing a microtask checkpoint</span> flag is false, then the user agent must run the
  following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let the <span>performing a microtask checkpoint</span> flag be true.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Microtask queue handling</i>: If the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>microtask
   queue</span> is empty, jump to the <i>done</i> step below.</p></li>

   <li><p>Select the oldest <span>microtask</span> on the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>microtask
   queue</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> to the <span
   data-x="concept-task">task</span> selected in the previous step.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><i>Run</i>: Run the selected <span data-x="concept-task">task</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">This might involve invoking scripted callbacks, which eventually calls the
    <span>clean up after running script</span> steps, which call this <span>perform a microtask
    checkpoint</span> algorithm again, which is why we use the <span>performing a microtask
    checkpoint</span> flag to avoid reentrancy.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> back to
   null.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove the <span>microtask</span> run in the step above from the <span>microtask
   queue</span>, and return to the <i>microtask queue handling</i> step.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Done</i>: For each <span>environment settings object</span> whose <span>responsible
   event loop</span> is this <span>event loop</span>, <span>notify about rejected promises</span>
   on that <span>environment settings object</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <span>performing a microtask checkpoint</span> flag be false.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>If, while a <span>compound microtask</span> is running, the user agent is required to
  <dfn data-export="">execute a compound microtask subtask</dfn> to run a series of steps, the user
  agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>parent</var> be the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running
   task</span> (the currently running <span>compound microtask</span>).</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>subtask</var> be a new <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that
   consists of running the given series of steps. The <span>task source</span> of such a
   <span>microtask</span> is the <span>microtask task source</span>. This is a <dfn>compound
   microtask subtask</dfn>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> to <var>subtask</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run <var>subtask</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running task</span> back to <var>parent</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>When an algorithm running <span>in parallel</span> is to <dfn>await a stable state</dfn>, the
  user agent must <span>queue a microtask</span> that runs the following steps, and must then stop
  executing (execution of the algorithm resumes when the microtask is run, as described in the
  following steps):</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Run the algorithm's <dfn>synchronous section</dfn>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Resumes execution of the algorithm <span>in parallel</span>, if appropriate, as described

  <p class="note">Steps in <span data-x="synchronous section">synchronous sections</span> are marked
  with &#x231B;.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When an algorithm says to <dfn>spin the event loop</dfn> until a condition <var>goal</var> is met, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>task</var> be the <span>event loop</span>'s <span>currently running
    task</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">This might be a <span>microtask</span>, in which case it is a <span>solitary
    callback microtask</span>. It could also be a <span>compound microtask subtask</span>, or a
    regular <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that is not a <span>microtask</span>. It will
    <em>not</em> be a <span>compound microtask</span>.</p> <!-- well, not unless we messed up in the
    speccing, anyway... -->

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var>task source</var> be <var>task</var>'s <span>task
   source</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>old stack</var> be a copy of the <span>JavaScript execution context
   stack</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Empty the <span>JavaScript execution context stack</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Run the global script clean-up jobs</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Perform a microtask checkpoint</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Stop <var>task</var>, allowing whatever algorithm that invoked it to resume, but
    continue these steps <span>in parallel</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">This causes one of the following algorithms to continue: the <span>event
    loop</span>'s main set of steps, the <span>perform a microtask checkpoint</span> algorithm, or
    the <span>execute a compound microtask subtask</span> algorithm.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to continue running these steps, using the <span>task

   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return to the caller.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical reasons, require the user agent to
  <dfn>pause</dfn> while running a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> until a condition <var>goal</var> is met. This means running the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If necessary, update the rendering or user interface of any <code>Document</code> or
   <span>browsing context</span> to reflect the current state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met. While a user agent has a paused
   <span data-x="concept-task">task</span>, the corresponding <span>event loop</span> must not run
   further <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>, and any script in the currently running <span
   data-x="concept-task">task</span> must block. User agents should remain responsive to user input
   while paused, however, albeit in a reduced capacity since the <span>event loop</span> will not be
   doing anything.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <div class="warning">
   <p><span data-x="pause">Pausing</span> is highly detrimental to the user experience, especially
   in scenarios where a single <span>event loop</span> is shared among multiple documents. User
   agents are encouraged to experiment with alternatives to <span data-x="pause">pausing</span>,
   such as <span data-x="spin the event loop">spinning the event loop</span> or even simply
   proceeding without any kind of suspended execution at all, insofar as it is possible to do so
   while preserving compatibility with existing content. This specification will happily change if
   a less-drastic alternative is discovered to be web-compatible.</p>

   <p>In the interim, implementers should be aware that the variety of alternatives that user agents
   might experiment with can change subtle aspects of <span>event loop</span> behavior, including
   <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> and <span>microtask</span> timing. Implementations should
   continue experimenting even if doing so causes them to violate the exact semantics implied by the
   <span>pause</span> operation.</p>
