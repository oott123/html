  <p>When the <dfn><code data-x="dom-print">print()</code></dfn> method is invoked, if the
  <code>Document</code> is <span>ready for post-load tasks</span>, then the user agent must
  run the <span>printing steps</span> <span>in parallel</span>. Otherwise, the user agent must only set the
  <dfn>print when loaded</dfn> flag on the <code>Document</code>.</p>

<!--TOPIC:HTML-->

  <p>User agents should also run the <span>printing steps</span> whenever the user asks for the
  opportunity to <span>obtain a physical form</span> (e.g. printed copy), or the representation of a
  physical form (e.g. PDF copy), of a document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>printing steps</dfn> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent may display a message to the user or abort these steps (or both).</p>

    <p class="example">For instance, a kiosk browser could silently ignore any invocations of the
    <code data-x="dom-print">print()</code> method.</p>

    <p class="example">For instance, a browser on a mobile device could detect that there are no
    printers in the vicinity and display a message saying so before continuing to offer a "save to
    PDF" option.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>active sandboxing flag set</span> of this <code>Window</code> object's <span
    data-x="concept-document-window">associated <code>Document</code></span> has the <span>sandboxed
    modals flag</span> set, then abort these steps.</p>

    <p class="note">If the printing dialog is blocked by a <code>Document</code>'s sandbox,
    then neither the <code data-x="event-beforeprint">beforeprint</code> nor <code
    data-x="event-afterprint">afterprint</code> events will be fired.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
    data-x="event-beforeprint">beforeprint</code> at the <code>Window</code> object of the
    <code>Document</code> that is being printed, as well as any <span data-x="nested browsing
    context">nested browsing contexts</span> in it.</p>

    <p class="example">The <code data-x="event-beforeprint">beforeprint</code> event can be used to
    annotate the printed copy, for instance adding the time at which the document was printed.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent should offer the user the opportunity to <span>obtain a physical form</span>
    (or the representation of a physical form) of the document. The user agent may wait for the user
    to either accept or decline before returning; if so, the user agent must <span>pause</span>
    while the method is waiting. Even if the user agent doesn't wait at this point, the user agent
    must use the state of the relevant documents as they are at this point in the algorithm if and
    when it eventually creates the alternate form.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
    data-x="event-afterprint">afterprint</code> at the <code>Window</code> object of the
    <code>Document</code> that is being printed, as well as any <span data-x="nested browsing
    context">nested browsing contexts</span> in it.</p>

    <p class="example">The <code data-x="event-afterprint">afterprint</code> event can be used to
    revert annotations added in the earlier event, as well as showing post-printing UI. For
    instance, if a page is walking the user through the steps of applying for a home loan, the
    script could automatically advance to the next step after having printed a form or other.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>
