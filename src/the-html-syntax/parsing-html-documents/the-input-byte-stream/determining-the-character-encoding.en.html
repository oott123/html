<h5>Determining the character encoding</h5>

  <p>In some cases, it might be impractical to unambiguously determine the encoding before parsing
  the document. Because of this, this specification provides for a two-pass mechanism with an
  optional pre-scan. Implementations are allowed, as described below, to apply a simplified parsing
  algorithm to whatever bytes they have available before beginning to parse the document. Then, the
  real parser is started, using a tentative encoding derived from this pre-parse and other
  out-of-band metadata. If, while the document is being loaded, the user agent discovers a character
  encoding declaration that conflicts with this information, then the parser can get reinvoked to
  perform a parse of the document with the real encoding.</p>

  <p id="documentEncoding">User agents must use the following algorithm, called the <dfn>encoding
  sniffing algorithm</dfn>, to determine the character encoding to use when decoding a document in
  the first pass. This algorithm takes as input any out-of-band metadata available to the user agent
  (e.g. the <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> of the document) and all the
  bytes available so far, and returns a character encoding and a <span
  data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> that is either <i>tentative</i> or
  <i>certain</i>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the user has explicitly instructed the user agent to override the document's character
    encoding with a specific encoding, optionally return that encoding with the <span
    data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>certain</i> and abort these steps.</p>

    <p class="note">Typically, user agents remember such user requests across sessions, and in some
    cases apply them to documents in <code>iframe</code>s as well.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent may wait for more bytes of the resource to be available, either in this step
    or at any later step in this algorithm. For instance, a user agent might wait 500ms or 1024
    bytes, whichever came first. In general preparsing the source to find the encoding improves
    performance, as it reduces the need to throw away the data structures used when parsing upon
    finding the encoding information. However, if the user agent delays too long to obtain data to
    determine the encoding, then the cost of the delay could outweigh any performance improvements
    from the preparse.</p>

    <p class="note">The authoring conformance requirements for character encoding declarations limit
    them to only appearing <a href="#charset1024">in the first 1024 bytes</a>. User agents are
    therefore encouraged to use the prescan algorithm below (as invoked by these steps) on the first
    1024 bytes, but not to stall beyond that.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the transport layer specifies a character encoding, and it is supported, return that
   encoding with the <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>certain</i>, and
   abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Optionally <span data-x="prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding">prescan the byte
    stream to determine its encoding</span>. The <var>end condition</var> is that the user
    agent decides that scanning further bytes would not be efficient. User agents are encouraged to
    only prescan the first 1024 bytes. User agents may decide that scanning <em>any</em> bytes is
    not efficient, in which case these substeps are entirely skipped.</p>

    <p>The aforementioned algorithm either aborts unsuccessfully or returns a character encoding. If
    it returns a character encoding, then this algorithm must be aborted, returning the same
    encoding, with <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>tentative</i>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>HTML parser</span> for which this algorithm is being run is associated with a
    <code>Document</code> that is itself in a <span>nested browsing context</span>, run these
    substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var>new document</var> be the <code>Document</code> with which the
     <span>HTML parser</span> is associated.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>parent document</var> be the <code>Document</code> <span
     data-x="browsing context nested through">through which <var>new document</var> is
     nested</span> (the <span>active document</span> of the <span>parent browsing context</span> of
     <var>new document</var>).</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>parent document</var>'s <span>origin</span> is not the <span>same
     origin</span> as <var>new document</var>'s <span>origin</span>, then abort these
     substeps.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>parent document</var>'s <span data-x="document's character
     encoding">character encoding</span> is not an <span>ASCII-compatible encoding</span>, then
     abort these substeps.</p></li>

     <li><p>Return <var>parent document</var>'s <span data-x="document's character
     encoding">character encoding</span>, with the <span
     data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>tentative</i>, and abort the
     <span>encoding sniffing algorithm</span>'s steps.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the user agent has information on the likely encoding for this page, e.g.
   based on the encoding of the page when it was last visited, then return that encoding, with the
   <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>tentative</i>, and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent may attempt to autodetect the character encoding from applying frequency
    analysis or other algorithms to the data stream. Such algorithms may use information about the
    resource other than the resource's contents, including the address of the resource. If
    autodetection succeeds in determining a character encoding, and that encoding is a supported
    encoding, then return that encoding, with the <span
    data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>tentative</i>, and abort these steps.
    <ref spec=UNIVCHARDET></p>

    <p class="note">User agents are generally discouraged from attempting to autodetect encodings
    for resources obtained over the network, since doing so involves inherently non-interoperable
    heuristics. Attempting to detect encodings based on an HTML document's preamble is especially
    tricky since HTML markup typically uses only ASCII characters, and HTML documents tend to begin
    with a lot of markup rather than with text content.</p>

    <p class="note">The UTF-8 encoding has a highly detectable bit pattern. Files from the local
    file system that contain bytes with values greater than 0x7F which match the UTF-8 pattern are
    very likely to be UTF-8, while documents with byte sequences that do not match it are very
    likely not. When a user agent can examine the whole file, rather than just the preamble,
    detecting for UTF-8 specifically can be especially effective. <ref spec=PPUTF8> <ref
    spec=UTF8DET></p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, return an implementation-defined or user-specified default character encoding,
    with the <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> <i>tentative</i>.</p>

    <p>In controlled environments or in environments where the encoding of documents can be
    prescribed (for example, for user agents intended for dedicated use in new networks), the
    comprehensive <code data-x="">UTF-8</code> encoding is suggested.</p>

    <p>In other environments, the default encoding is typically dependent on the user's locale (an
    approximation of the languages, and thus often encodings, of the pages that the user is likely
    to frequent). The following table gives suggested defaults based on the user's locale, for
    compatibility with legacy content. Locales are identified by BCP 47 language tags. <ref spec=BCP47> <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

         several assumptions were made in this process; amongst them:
          - ISO-8859-1 and windows-1252 are the same (supported by encoding.spec.whatwg.org)
          - ISO-8859-9 and windows-1254 are the same (supported by encoding.spec.whatwg.org)
          - windows-31J and Shift_JIS are the same (supported by encoding.spec.whatwg.org)
          - windows-932 is close enough to Shift_JIS to be treated as equivalent (supported by wikipedia)
          - windows-936 is a basically a subset of GBK which is basically a subset of gb18030 (supported by wikipedia)
          - windows-950 is basically the same as Big5 (supported by wikipedia)
          - Firefox's UTF-8 defaults are all bogus

  point during these steps (including during instances of the <span

  one) the user agent either runs out of bytes (meaning the <var>position</var> pointer
