  <h6 id="parsing-main-inselectintable">The "<dfn data-x="insertion mode: in select in table">in select in table</dfn>" insertion mode</h6>

  <p>When the user agent is to apply the rules for the "<span data-x="insertion mode: in select in
  table">in select in table</span>" <span>insertion mode</span>, the user agent must handle the
  token as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>A start tag whose tag name is one of: "caption", "table", "tbody", "tfoot", "thead", "tr",
   "td", "th"</dt>
   <dd>

    <p><span>Parse error</span>.</p>

    <!-- fake </select> -->
    <p>Pop elements from the <span>stack of open elements</span> until a <code>select</code> element
    has been popped from the stack.</p>

    <p><span>Reset the insertion mode appropriately</span>.</p>
    <!-- end of fake </select> -->

    <p>Reprocess the token.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>An end tag whose tag name is one of: "caption", "table", "tbody", "tfoot", "thead", "tr",
   "td", "th"</dt>
   <dd>

    <p><span>Parse error</span>.</p>

    <p>If the <span>stack of open elements</span> does not <span data-x="has an element in table
    scope">have an element in table scope</span> that is an <span data-x="HTML elements">HTML
    element</span> with the same tag name as that of the token, then ignore the token.</p>

    <p>Otherwise:</p>

    <!-- fake </select> -->
    <p>Pop elements from the <span>stack of open elements</span> until a <code>select</code> element
    has been popped from the stack.</p>

    <p><span>Reset the insertion mode appropriately</span>.</p>
    <!-- end of fake </select> -->

    <p>Reprocess the token.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Anything else</dt>
   <dd>

    <p>Process the token <span>using the rules for</span> the "<span data-x="insertion mode: in
    select">in select</span>" <span>insertion mode</span>.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>
