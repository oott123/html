  <h6>The "<dfn data-x="insertion mode: after after body">after after body</dfn>" insertion mode</h6>

  <p>When the user agent is to apply the rules for the "<span data-x="insertion mode: after after
  body">after after body</span>" <span>insertion mode</span>, the user agent must handle the token
  as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>A comment token</dt>
   <dd>
    <p><span>Insert a comment</span> as the last child of the <code>Document</code> object.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>A character token that is one of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C
   FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), or U+0020 SPACE</dt>
   <dt>A start tag whose tag name is "html"</dt>
   <dd>

    <p>Process the token <span>using the rules for</span> the "<span data-x="insertion mode: in
    body">in body</span>" <span>insertion mode</span>.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>An end-of-file token</dt>
   <dd>
    <p><span>Stop parsing</span>.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Anything else</dt>
   <dd>

    <p><span>Parse error</span>. Switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span data-x="insertion
    mode: in body">in body</span>" and reprocess the token.</p>
