  <h3 id="parsing">Parsing HTML documents</h3>

  <p><i>This section only applies to user agents, data mining tools, and conformance
  checkers.</i></p>

  <p class="note">The rules for parsing XML documents into DOM trees are covered by the next
  section, entitled "<span>The XML syntax</span>".</p>

  <p>User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from
  <code>text/html</code> resources. Together, these rules define what is referred to as the
  <dfn data-export="">HTML parser</dfn>.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>While the HTML syntax described in this specification bears a close resemblance to SGML and
   XML, it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.</p>

   <p>Some earlier versions of HTML (in particular from HTML2 to HTML4) were based on SGML and used
   SGML parsing rules. However, few (if any) web browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing for
   HTML documents; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML application have
   historically been validators. The resulting confusion &mdash; with validators claiming documents
   to have one representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably implemented a
   different representation &mdash; has wasted decades of productivity. This version of HTML thus
   returns to a non-SGML basis.</p>

   <p>Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring pipeline are encouraged to use XML
   tools and the XML serialization of HTML.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether they are syntactically
  correct or not. Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said to be <dfn data-x="parse
  error">parse errors</dfn>. The error handling for parse errors is well-defined (that's the
  processing rules described throughout this specification), but user agents, while parsing an HTML
  document, may <span data-x="abort a parser">abort the parser</span> at the first <span>parse
  error</span> that they encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described in this
  specification.</p>

  <p>Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error condition to the user if one or more
  parse error conditions exist in the document and must not report parse error conditions if none
  exist in the document. Conformance checkers may report more than one parse error condition if more
  than one parse error condition exists in the document.</p>

  <p class="note">Parse errors are only errors with the <em>syntax</em> of HTML. In addition to
  checking for parse errors, conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all the
  other conformance requirements described in this specification.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of conformance checkers, if a resource is determined to be in <span>the HTML
  syntax</span>, then it is an <span data-x="HTML documents">HTML document</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">As stated <span class="no-backref" data-x="HTML elements">in the terminology
  section</span>, references to <span data-x="element type">element types</span> that do not
  explicitly specify a namespace always refer to elements in the <span>HTML namespace</span>. For
  example, if the spec talks about "a <code>menuitem</code> element", then that is an element with
  the local name "<code data-x="">menuitem</code>", the namespace "<code
  data-x="">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>", and the interface <code>HTMLMenuItemElement</code>.
  Where possible, references to such elements are hyperlinked to their definition.</p>
