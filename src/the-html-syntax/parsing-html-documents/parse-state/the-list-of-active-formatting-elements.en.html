  <h5>The list of active formatting elements</h5>

  <p>Initially, the <dfn>list of active formatting elements</dfn> is empty. It is used to handle
  mis-nested <span data-x="formatting">formatting element tags</span>.</p>

  <p>The list contains elements in the <span>formatting</span> category, and <span
  data-x="concept-parser-marker">markers</span>. The <dfn
  data-x="concept-parser-marker">markers</dfn> are inserted when entering <code>applet</code>,
  <code>object</code>, <code>marquee</code>, <code>template</code>, <code>td</code>,
  <code>th</code>, and <code>caption</code> elements, and are used to prevent formatting from
  "leaking" <em>into</em> <code>applet</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>marquee</code>,
  <code>template</code>, <code>td</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>caption</code> elements.</p>

  <p>In addition, each element in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span> is associated
  with the token for which it was created, so that further elements can be created for that token if
  necessary.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>push onto the list of active formatting
  elements</dfn> an element <var>element</var>, the UA must perform the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol id="noah">

   <li><p>If there are already three elements in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>
   after the last <span data-x="concept-parser-marker">marker</span>, if any, or anywhere in the
   list if there are no <span data-x="concept-parser-marker">markers</span>, that have the same tag
   name, namespace, and attributes as <var>element</var>, then remove the earliest such
   element from the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>. For these purposes, the
   attributes must be compared as they were when the elements were created by the parser; two
   elements have the same attributes if all their parsed attributes can be paired such that the two
   attributes in each pair have identical names, namespaces, and values (the order of the attributes
   does not matter).</p>

   <p class="note">This is the Noah's Ark clause. But with three per family instead of two.</p></li>
   <!-- A sort of polyamorous Noah's Ark, if you will. -->

   <li><p>Add <var>element</var> to the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reconstruct the active formatting elements</dfn>,
  the UA must perform the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If there are no entries in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>, then there
   is nothing to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the last (most recently added) entry in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span> is a <span data-x="concept-parser-marker">marker</span>, or if it is an element
   that is in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, then there is nothing to reconstruct; stop
   this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>entry</var> be the last (most recently added) element in the <span>list
   of active formatting elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Rewind</i>: If there are no entries before <var>entry</var> in the <span>list
   of active formatting elements</span>, then jump to the step labeled <i>create</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>entry</var> be the entry one earlier than <var>entry</var> in
   the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>entry</var> is neither a <span
   data-x="concept-parser-marker">marker</span> nor an element that is also in the <span>stack of
   open elements</span>, go to the step labeled <i>rewind</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Advance</i>: Let <var>entry</var> be the element one later than <var>entry</var> in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Create</i>: <span>Insert an HTML element</span> for the token for which the element
   <var>entry</var> was created, to obtain <var>new element</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace the entry for <var>entry</var> in the list with an entry for <var>new element</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the entry for <var>new element</var> in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span> is not the last entry in the list, return to the step labeled
   <i>advance</i>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that were opened in the current
  body, cell, or caption (whichever is youngest) that haven't been explicitly closed.</p>

  <p class="note">The way this specification is written, the <span>list of active formatting
  elements</span> always consists of elements in chronological order with the least recently added
  element first and the most recently added element last (except for while steps 7 to 10 of the
  above algorithm are being executed, of course).</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>clear the list of active formatting elements up to
  the last marker</dfn>, the UA must perform the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>entry</var> be the last (most recently added) entry in the <span>list of
   active formatting elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove <var>entry</var> from the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>entry</var> was a <span data-x="concept-parser-marker">marker</span>,
   then stop the algorithm at this point. The list has been cleared up to the last <span
   data-x="concept-parser-marker">marker</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Go to step 1.</p></li>

  </ol>
