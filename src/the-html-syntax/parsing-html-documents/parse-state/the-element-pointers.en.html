  <h5>The element pointers</h5>

  <p>Initially, the <dfn><code data-x="">head</code> element pointer</dfn> and the <dfn><code
  data-x="">form</code> element pointer</dfn> are both null.</p>

  <p>Once a <code>head</code> element has been parsed (whether implicitly or explicitly) the
  <span><code data-x="">head</code> element pointer</span> gets set to point to this node.</p>

  <p>The <span><code data-x="">form</code> element pointer</span> points to the last
  <code>form</code> element that was opened and whose end tag has not yet been seen. It is used to
  make form controls associate with forms in the face of dramatically bad markup, for historical
  reasons. It is ignored inside <code>template</code> elements.</p>
