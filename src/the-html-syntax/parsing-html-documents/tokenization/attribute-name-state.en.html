  <p>When the user agent leaves the attribute name state (and before emitting the tag token, if
  appropriate), the complete attribute's name must be compared to the other attributes on the same
  token; if there is already an attribute on the token with the exact same name, then this is a
  <span>parse error</span> and the new attribute must be removed from the token.</p>

  <p class="note">If an attribute is so removed from a token, it, and the value that gets associated
  with it, if any, are never subsequently used by the parser, and are therefore effectively
  discarded. Removing the attribute in this way does not change its status as the "current
  attribute" for the purposes of the tokenizer, however.</p>
