<h4><dfn>Tokenization</dfn></h4>

  <p>Implementations must act as if they used the following state machine to tokenize HTML. The
  state machine must start in the <span>data state</span>. Most states consume a single character,
  which may have various side-effects, and either switches the state machine to a new state to
  <span>reconsume</span> the <span>current input character</span>, or switches it to a new state to
  consume the <span data-x="next input character">next character</span>, or stays in the same state
  to consume the next character. Some states have more complicated behavior and can consume several
  characters before switching to another state. In some cases, the tokenizer state is also changed
  by the tree construction stage.</p>

  <p>When a state says to <dfn>reconsume</dfn> a matched character in a specified state, that means
  to switch to that state, but when it attempts to consume the <span>next input character</span>,
  provide it with the <span>current input character</span> instead.</p>

  <p>The exact behavior of certain states depends on the <span>insertion mode</span> and the
  <span>stack of open elements</span>. Certain states also use a <dfn><var data-x="temporary
  buffer">temporary buffer</var></dfn> to track progress, and the <span>character reference
  state</span> uses a <dfn><var data-x="return state">return state</var></dfn> to return to the
  state it was invoked from.</p>

  <p>The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more of the following tokens:
  DOCTYPE, start tag, end tag, comment, character, end-of-file. DOCTYPE tokens have a name, a public
  identifier, a system identifier, and a <dfn><i>force-quirks flag</i></dfn>. When a DOCTYPE token
  is created, its name, public identifier, and system identifier must be marked as missing (which is
  a distinct state from the empty string), and the <i data-x="force-quirks flag">force-quirks flag</i> must be set to
  <i>off</i> (its other state is <i>on</i>). Start and end tag tokens have a tag name, a <dfn
  data-x="self-closing flag">self-closing flag</dfn>, and a list of attributes, each of which has a
  name and a value. When a start or end tag token is created, its <i data-x="self-closing
  flag">self-closing flag</i> must be unset (its other state is that it be set), and its attributes
  list must be empty. Comment and character tokens have data.</p>

  <p>When a token is emitted, it must immediately be handled by the <span>tree construction</span>
  stage. The tree construction stage can affect the state of the tokenization stage, and can insert
  additional characters into the stream. (For example, the <code>script</code> element can result in
  scripts executing and using the <span>dynamic markup insertion</span> APIs to insert characters
  into the stream being tokenized.)</p>

  <p class="note">Creating a token and emitting it are distinct actions. It is possible for a token
  to be created but implicitly abandoned (never emitted), e.g. if the file ends unexpectedly while
  processing the characters that are being parsed into a start tag token.</p>

  <p>When a start tag token is emitted with its <i data-x="self-closing flag">self-closing flag</i> set, if the flag is not
  <dfn data-x="acknowledge self-closing flag">acknowledged</dfn> when it is processed by the tree
  construction stage, that is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>When an end tag token is emitted with attributes, that is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>When an end tag token is emitted with its <i data-x="self-closing flag">self-closing flag</i> set, that is a <span>parse
  error</span>.</p>

  <p>An <dfn>appropriate end tag token</dfn> is an end tag token whose tag name matches the tag name
  of the last start tag to have been emitted from this tokenizer, if any. If no start tag has been
  emitted from this tokenizer, then no end tag token is appropriate.</p>

  <p id="check-parser-pause-flag">Before each step of the tokenizer, the user agent must first check
  the <span>parser pause flag</span>. If it is true, then the tokenizer must abort the processing of
  any nested invocations of the tokenizer, yielding control back to the caller.</p>

  <p>The tokenizer state machine consists of the states defined in the following subsections.</p>
