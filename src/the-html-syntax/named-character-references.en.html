   If we want to add character references, Almorca suggests:
   > I would add &sub1; (character U+2081), &sub2; (character U+2082) and &sub3; (character U+2083).
   > They would are the equivalent to &sup1;, &sup2;, and &sup3;.

  <p>This data is also available <a href="/entities.json">as a JSON file</a>.</p>

  <p><i>The glyphs displayed above are non-normative. Refer to the Unicode specifications for formal
  definitions of the characters listed above.</i></p>

  <p class="note">The character reference names originate from the <cite>XML Entity Definitions for
  Characters</cite> specification, though only the above is considered normative. <ref
