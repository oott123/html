  <h4>Elements</h4>

  <p>There are five different kinds of <dfn data-x="syntax-elements">elements</dfn>: <span>void
  elements</span>, <span>raw text elements</span>, <span>escapable raw text elements</span>,
  <span>foreign elements</span>, and <span>normal elements</span>.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>Void elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd><code>area</code>, <code>base</code>, <code>br</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>embed</code>,
   <code>hr</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>keygen</code>, <code>link</code>,
   <code>meta</code>, <code>param</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>track</code>,
   <code>wbr</code></dd>
   <!-- see also other places that say VOIDLIST -->

   <dt><dfn>Raw text elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd><code>script</code>, <code>style</code></dd> <!-- iframe and noscript don't count as raw text
   for syntax purposes -->

   <dt><dfn>escapable raw text elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd><code>textarea</code>, <code>title</code></dd>

   <dt><dfn>Foreign elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Elements from the <span>MathML namespace</span> and the <span>SVG namespace</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>Normal elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd>All other allowed <span>HTML elements</span> are normal elements.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p><dfn data-x="syntax-tags">Tags</dfn> are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the
  markup. <span data-x="raw text elements">Raw text</span>, <span data-x="escapable raw text
  elements">escapable raw text</span>, and <span data-x="normal elements">normal</span> elements have
  a <span data-x="syntax-start-tag">start tag</span> to indicate where they begin, and an <span
  data-x="syntax-end-tag">end tag</span> to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of
  certain <span>normal elements</span> can be <span data-x="syntax-tag-omission">omitted</span>, as
  described below in the section on <span data-x="syntax-tag-omission">optional tags</span>. Those
  that cannot be omitted must not be omitted. <span>Void elements</span> only have a start tag; end
  tags must not be specified for <span>void elements</span>. <span>Foreign elements</span> must
  either have a start tag and an end tag, or a start tag that is marked as self-closing, in which
  case they must not have an end tag.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="concept-html-contents">contents</span> of the element must be placed between
  just after the start tag (which <span data-x="syntax-tag-omission">might be implied, in certain
  cases</span>) and just before the end tag (which again, <span data-x="syntax-tag-omission">might be
  implied in certain cases</span>). The exact allowed contents of each individual element depend on
  the <span data-x="content models">content model</span> of that element, as described earlier in
  this specification. Elements must not contain content that their content model disallows. In
  addition to the restrictions placed on the contents by those content models, however, the five
  types of elements have additional <em>syntactic</em> requirements.</p>

  <p><span>Void elements</span> can't have any contents (since there's no end tag, no content can be
  put between the start tag and the end tag).</p>

  <p><span>Raw text elements</span> can have <span data-x="syntax-text">text</span>, though it has <a
  href="#cdata-rcdata-restrictions">restrictions</a> described below.</p>

  <p><span>Escapable raw text elements</span> can have <span data-x="syntax-text">text</span> and
  <span data-x="syntax-charref">character references</span>, but the text must not contain an <span
  data-x="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous ampersand</span>. There are also <a
  href="#cdata-rcdata-restrictions">further restrictions</a> described below.</p>

  <p><span>Foreign elements</span> whose start tag is marked as self-closing can't have any contents
  (since, again, as there's no end tag, no content can be put between the start tag and the end
  tag). <span>Foreign elements</span> whose start tag is <em>not</em> marked as self-closing can
  have <span data-x="syntax-text">text</span>, <span data-x="syntax-charref">character
  references</span>, <span data-x="syntax-cdata">CDATA sections</span>, other <span
  data-x="syntax-elements">elements</span>, and <span data-x="syntax-comments">comments</span>, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an <span
  data-x="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous ampersand</span>.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The HTML syntax does not support namespace declarations, even in <span>foreign
   elements</span>.</p>

   <p>For instance, consider the following HTML fragment:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>
 &lt;svg>
  &lt;metadata>
   &lt;!-- this is invalid -->
   &lt;cdr:license xmlns:cdr="https://www.example.com/cdr/metadata" name="MIT"/>
  &lt;/metadata>
 &lt;/svg>
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>The innermost element, <code data-x="">cdr:license</code>, is actually in the SVG namespace, as
   the "<code data-x="">xmlns:cdr</code>" attribute has no effect (unlike in XML). In fact, as the
   comment in the fragment above says, the fragment is actually non-conforming. This is because the
   SVG specification does not define any elements called "<code data-x="">cdr:license</code>" in the
   SVG namespace.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span>Normal elements</span> can have <span data-x="syntax-text">text</span>, <span
  data-x="syntax-charref">character references</span>, other <span
  data-x="syntax-elements">elements</span>, and <span data-x="syntax-comments">comments</span>, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an <span
  data-x="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous ampersand</span>. Some <span>normal elements</span>
  also have <a href="#element-restrictions">yet more restrictions</a> on what content they are
  allowed to hold, beyond the restrictions imposed by the content model and those described in this
  paragraph. Those restrictions are described below.</p>

  <p>Tags contain a <dfn data-x="syntax-tag-name">tag name</dfn>, giving the element's name. HTML
  elements all have names that only use <span>alphanumeric ASCII characters</span>. In the HTML
  syntax, tag names, even those for <span>foreign elements</span>, may be written with any mix of
  lower- and uppercase letters that, when converted to all-lowercase, matches the element's tag
  name; tag names are case-insensitive.</p>
