  <h4>Warnings for obsolete but conforming features</h4>

  <p>To ease the transition from HTML4 Transitional documents to the language defined in
  <em>this</em> specification, and to discourage certain features that are only allowed in very few
  circumstances, conformance checkers must warn the user when the following features are used in a
  document. These are generally old obsolete features that have no effect, and are allowed only to
  distinguish between likely mistakes (regular conformance errors) and mere vestigial markup or
  unusual and discouraged practices (these warnings).</p>

  <p>The following features must be categorized as described
  above:</p>

  <ul><!-- downplayed list -->

   <li><p>The presence of a <code data-x="attr-img-border">border</code> attribute on an
   <code>img</code> element if its value is the string "<code data-x="">0</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p>The presence of a <code data-x="attr-script-language">language</code> attribute on a
   <code>script</code> element if its value is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the
   string "<code data-x="">JavaScript</code>" and if there is no <code
   data-x="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute or there is and its value is an <span>ASCII
   case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code data-x="">text/javascript</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p>The presence of a <code data-x="attr-a-name">name</code> attribute on an <code>a</code>
   element, if its value is not the empty string.</p></li>

   <li><p>The presence of a <code data-x="attr-input-maxlength">maxlength</code> attribute on an
   <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the
   <span data-x="attr-input-type-number">Number</span> state.</p></li>

   <li><p>The presence of a <code data-x="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute on an
   <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the
   <span data-x="attr-input-type-number">Number</span> state.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>Conformance checkers must distinguish between pages that have no conformance errors and have
  none of these obsolete features, and pages that have no conformance errors but do have some of
  these obsolete features.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a validator could report some pages as "Valid HTML" and others as
  "Valid HTML with warnings".</p>
