  <h3>The CSS user agent style sheet and presentational hints</h3>

  <p>The CSS rules given in these subsections are, except where otherwise specified, expected to be
  used as part of the user-agent level style sheet defaults for all documents that contain
  <span>HTML elements</span>.</p>

  <p>Some rules are intended for the author-level zero-specificity presentational hints part of the
  CSS cascade; these are explicitly called out as <dfn>presentational hints</dfn>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the text below says that an attribute <var>attribute</var> on an element
  <var>element</var> <dfn>maps to the pixel length property</dfn> (or properties)
  <var>properties</var>, it means that if <var>element</var> has an attribute <var>attribute</var>
  set, and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> doesn't generate an error, then the user agent is expected to use the parsed value
  as a pixel length for a <span data-x="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for
  <var>properties</var>.</p>

  <p>When the text below says that an attribute <var>attribute</var> on an element
  <var>element</var> <dfn>maps to the dimension property</dfn> (or properties)
  <var>properties</var>, it means that if <var>element</var> has an attribute <var>attribute</var>
  set, and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing dimension values</span>
  doesn't generate an error, then the user agent is expected to use the parsed dimension as the
  value for a <span data-x="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for
  <var>properties</var>, with the value given as a pixel length if the dimension was a length, and
  with the value given as a percentage if the dimension was a percentage.</p>

  <p>When the text below says that an attribute <var>attribute</var> on an element
  <var>element</var> <dfn>maps to the dimension property (ignoring zero)</dfn> (or properties)
  <var>properties</var>, it means that if <var>element</var> has an attribute <var>attribute</var>
  set, and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing non-zero dimension
  values</span> doesn't generate an error, then the user agent is expected to use the parsed
  dimension as the value for a <span data-x="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for
  <var>properties</var>, with the value given as a pixel length if the dimension was a length, and
  with the value given as a percentage if the dimension was a percentage.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>align descendants</dfn> of a node, the user agent is expected to
  align only those descendants that have both their <span>'margin-inline-start'</span> and
  <span>'margin-inline-end'</span> properties computing to a value other than 'auto', that are
  over-constrained and that have one of those two margins with a <span>used value</span> forced to a
  greater value, and that do not themselves have an applicable <code data-x="">align</code>
  attribute. When multiple elements are to <span data-x="align descendants">align</span> a
  particular descendant, the most deeply nested such element is expected to override the others.
  Aligned elements are expected to be aligned by having the <span data-x="used value">used
  values</span> of their margins on the <span>line-left</span> and <span>line-right</span> sides be
  set accordingly. <ref spec=CSSLOGICAL> <ref spec=CSSWM></p>
