  <h4 id="embedded-content-rendering-rules">Embedded content</h4>

  <p>The <code>embed</code>, <code>iframe</code>, and <code>video</code> elements are expected to be
  treated as <span data-x="replaced element">replaced elements</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>canvas</code> element that <span>represents</span> <span>embedded content</span> is
  expected to be treated as a <span>replaced element</span>; the contents of such elements are the
  element's bitmap, if any, or else a transparent black bitmap with the same <span>intrinsic
  dimensions</span> as the element. Other <code>canvas</code> elements are expected to be treated
  as ordinary elements in the rendering model.</p>

  <p>An <code>object</code> element that <span>represents</span> an image, plugin, or <span>nested
  browsing context</span> is expected to be treated as a <span>replaced element</span>. Other
  <code>object</code> elements are expected to be treated as ordinary elements in the rendering
  model.</p>

  <p>An <code>applet</code> element that <span>represents</span> a <span>plugin</span> is expected
  to be treated as a <span>replaced element</span>. Other <code>applet</code> elements are expected
  to be treated as ordinary elements in the rendering model.</p>

  <p>The <code>audio</code> element, when it is <span data-x="expose a user interface to the
  user">exposing a user interface</span>, is expected to be treated as a
  <span>replaced element</span> about one line high, as wide as is necessary to expose the user
  agent's user interface features. When an <code>audio</code> element is not <span data-x="expose a
  user interface to the user">exposing a user interface</span>, the user agent is expected to force
  its <span>'display'</span> property to compute to 'none', irrespective of CSS rules.</p>

  <p>Whether a <code>video</code> element is <span data-x="expose a user interface to the
  user">exposing a user interface</span> is not expected to affect the size of the rendering;
  controls are expected to be overlaid above the page content without causing any layout changes,
  and are expected to disappear when the user does not need them.</p>

  <p>When a <code>video</code> element represents a poster frame or frame of video, the poster frame
  or frame of video is expected to be rendered at the largest size that maintains the aspect ratio
  of that poster frame or frame of video without being taller or wider than the <code>video</code>
  element itself, and is expected to be centered in the <code>video</code> element.</p>

  <p>Any subtitles or captions are expected to be overlayed directly on top of their
  <code>video</code> element, as defined by the relevant rendering rules; for WebVTT, those are the
  <span>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</span>. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p>

  <p>When the user agent starts <span data-x="expose a user interface to the user">exposing a user
  interface</span> for a <code>video</code> element, the user agent should run the <span>rules for
  updating the text track rendering</span> of each of the <span data-x="text track">text
  tracks</span> in the <code>video</code> element's <span>list of text tracks</span> that are <span
  data-x="text track showing">showing</span> and whose <span>text track kind</span> is one of <code
  data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-subtitles">subtitles</code> or <code
  data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-captions">captions</code> (e.g., for <span data-x="text track">text
  tracks</span> based on WebVTT, the <span>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text
  tracks</span>). <ref spec=WEBVTT></p>

  <p class="note">Resizing <code>video</code> and <code>canvas</code> elements does not interrupt
  video playback or clear the canvas.</p>

  <p>The following CSS rules are expected to apply:</p>

iframe { border: 2px inset; }
<span id="video-object-fit">video { object-fit: contain; }</span></pre>
