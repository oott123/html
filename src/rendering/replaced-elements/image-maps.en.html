  <h4>Image maps</h4>

  <p>Shapes on an <span>image map</span> are expected to act, for the purpose of the CSS cascade, as
  elements independent of the original <code>area</code> element that happen to match the same style
  rules but inherit from the <code>img</code> or <code>object</code> element.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of the rendering, only the <span>'cursor'</span> property is expected to have
  any effect on the shape.</p>

  <p class="example">Thus, for example, if an <code>area</code> element has a <code
  data-x="attr-style">style</code> attribute that sets the <span>'cursor'</span> property to 'help',
  then when the user designates that shape, the cursor would change to a Help cursor.</p>

  <p class="example">Similarly, if an <code>area</code> element had a CSS rule that set its
  <span>'cursor'</span> property to 'inherit' (or if no rule setting the <span>'cursor'</span>
  property matched the element at all), the shape's cursor would be inherited from the
  <code>img</code> or <code>object</code> element of the <span>image map</span>, not from the parent
  of the <code>area</code> element.</p>
