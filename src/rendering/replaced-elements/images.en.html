  <h4>Images</h4>

  <p>User agents are expected to render <code>img</code> elements and <code>input</code> elements
  whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attributes are in the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state, according to the first applicable rules
  from the following list:</p>

  <dl class="switch">


   <dt>If the element <span>represents</span> an image</dt>

   <dd>The user agent is expected to treat the element as a <span>replaced element</span> and
   render the image according to the rules for doing so defined in CSS.</dd>


   <dt>

    If the element does not <span data-x="represents">represent</span> an image, but the element
    already has <span>intrinsic dimensions</span> (e.g. from the <span>dimension attributes</span>
    or CSS rules), and either:

    <ul>

     <li>the user agent has reason to believe that the image will become <i
     data-x="img-available">available</i><!--input-img-available also--> and be rendered in due
     course, or

     <li>the element has no <code data-x="">alt</code> attribute<!-- attr-img-alt, attr-input-alt -->, or

     <li>the <code>Document</code> is in <span>quirks mode</span>

    </ul>

   </dt>

   <dd>The user agent is expected to treat the element as a <span>replaced element</span> whose
   content is the text that the element represents, if any, optionally alongside an icon indicating
   that the image is being obtained (if applicable). For <code>input</code> elements, the element
   is expected to appear button-like to indicate that the element is a <span
   data-x="concept-button">button</span>.</dd>


   <!-- no-quirks and limited-quirks modes only-->
   <dt>If the element is an <code>img</code> element that <span>represents</span> some text and the
   user agent does not expect this to change</dt>

   <dd>The user agent is expected to treat the element as a non-replaced phrasing element whose
   content is the text, optionally with an icon indicating that an image is missing, so that the
   user can request the image be displayed or investigate why it is not rendering. In non-graphical
   contexts, such an icon should be omitted.</dd>


   <!-- no-quirks and limited-quirks modes only-->
   <dt>If the element is an <code>img</code> element that <span>represents</span> nothing and the
   user agent does not expect this to change</dt>

   <dd>The user agent is expected to treat the element as an empty inline element. (In the absence
   of further styles, this will cause the element to essentially not be rendered.)</dd>


   <!-- no-quirks and limited-quirks modes only-->
   <dt>If the element is an <code>input</code> element that does not <span
   data-x="represents">represent</span> an image and the user agent does not expect this to change</dt>

   <dd>The user agent is expected to treat the element as a <span>replaced element</span>
   consisting of a button whose content is the element's alternative text. The <span>intrinsic
   dimensions</span> of the button are expected to be about one line in height and whatever width
   is necessary to render the text on one line.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The icons mentioned above are expected to be relatively small so as not to disrupt most text
  but be easily clickable. In a visual environment, for instance, icons could be 16 pixels by 16
  pixels square, or 1em by 1em if the images are scalable. In an audio environment, the icon could
  be a short bleep. The icons are intended to indicate to the user that they can be used to get to
  whatever options the UA provides for images, and, where appropriate, are expected to provide
  access to the context menu that would have come up if the user interacted with the actual
  image.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>All animated images with the same <span>absolute URL</span> and the same image data are
  expected to be rendered synchronized to the same timeline as a group, with the timeline starting
  at the time of the least recent addition to the group.</p>

  <p class="note">In other words, when a second image with the same <span>absolute URL</span> and
  animated image data is inserted into a document, it jumps to the point in the animation cycle that
  is currently being displayed by the first image.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>restart the animation</dfn> for an <code>img</code> element
  showing an animated image, all animated images with the same <span>absolute URL</span> and the
  same image data in that <code>img</code> element's <span>node document</span> are expected to restart
  their animation from the beginning.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The following CSS rules are expected to apply when the <code>Document</code> is in <span>quirks
  mode</span>:</p>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

img[align=left i] { margin-right: 3px; }
img[align=right i] { margin-left: 3px; }</pre>

  </div>
