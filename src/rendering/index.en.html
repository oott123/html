<h2 split-filename="rendering" id="rendering">Rendering</h2>

  <p><i>User agents are not required to present HTML documents in any particular way. However, this
  section provides a set of suggestions for rendering HTML documents that, if followed, are likely
  to lead to a user experience that closely resembles the experience intended by the documents'
  authors. So as to avoid confusion regarding the normativity of this section, "must" has not been
  used. Instead, the term "expected" is used to indicate behavior that will lead to this experience.
  For the purposes of conformance for user agents designated as <a href="#renderingUA">supporting
  the suggested default rendering</a>, the term "expected" in this section has the same conformance
  implications as "must".</i></p>
