<h4>Editing hosts</h4>

  <p>The current text editing caret (i.e. the <span>active range</span>, if it is empty and in an
  <span>editing host</span>), if any, is expected to act like an inline
  <span>replaced element</span> with the vertical dimensions of the caret and with zero width for
  the purposes of the CSS rendering model.</p>

  <p class="note">This means that even an empty block can have the caret inside it, and that when
  the caret is in such an element, it prevents <span data-x="collapsing margins">margins from
  collapsing</span> through the element.</p>
