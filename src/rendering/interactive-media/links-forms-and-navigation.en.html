  <h4>Links, forms, and navigation</h4>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow the user to control aspects of <span>hyperlink</span>
  activation and <span>form submission</span>, such as which <span>browsing context</span> is to be
  used for the subsequent <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow users to discover the destination of <span
  data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> and of <span data-x="form">forms</span> before triggering their
  <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to inform the user of whether a <span>hyperlink</span> includes
  <span>hyperlink auditing</span>, and to let them know at a minimum which domains will be contacted
  as part of such auditing.</p>

  <p>User agents may allow users to <span>navigate</span><!--DONAV cite=""--> <span data-x="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span> to the URLs <span data-x="parse a url">indicated</span> by the
  <code data-x="">cite</code> attributes on <code>q</code>, <code>blockquote</code>,
  <code>ins</code>, and <code>del</code> elements.</p>

  <p>User agents may surface <span data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> created by <code>link</code>
  elements in their user interface.</p>

  <p class="note">While <code>link</code> elements that create <span
  data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> will match the <code data-x="selector-link">:link</code> or
  <code data-x="selector-visited">:visited</code> <span data-x="pseudo-class">pseudo-classes</span>,
  will react to clicks if visible, and so forth, this does not extend to any browser interface
  constructs that expose those same links. Activating a link through the browser's interface, rather
  than in the page itself, does not trigger <code data-x="event-click">click</code> events and the
  like.</p>
