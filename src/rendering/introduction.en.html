<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In general, user agents are expected to support CSS, and many of the suggestions in this
  section are expressed in CSS terms. User agents that use other presentation mechanisms can derive
  their expected behavior by translating from the CSS rules given in this section.</p>

  <p>In the absence of style-layer rules to the contrary (e.g. author style sheets), user agents are
  expected to render an element so that it conveys to the user the meaning that the element
  <span>represents</span>, as described by this specification.</p>

  <p>The suggestions in this section generally assume a visual output medium with a resolution of
  96dpi or greater, but HTML is intended to apply to multiple media (it is a
  <i>media-independent</i> language). User agent implementors are encouraged to adapt the
  suggestions in this section to their target media.</p>

  <p>An element is <dfn>being rendered</dfn> if it has any associated CSS layout boxes, SVG layout
  boxes, or some equivalent in other styling languages.</p>

  <p class="note">Just being off-screen does not mean the element is not <span>being
  rendered</span>. The presence of the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute normally
  means the element is not <span>being rendered</span>, though this might be overridden by the style
  sheets.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>User agents that do not honor author-level CSS style sheets are nonetheless expected to act as
  if they applied the CSS rules given in these sections in a manner consistent with this
  specification and the relevant CSS and Unicode specifications. <ref spec=CSS> <ref spec=UNICODE> <ref spec=BIDI></p>

  <p class="note">This is especially important for issues relating to the <span>'display'</span>,
  <span>'unicode-bidi'</span>, and <span>'direction'</span> properties.</p>
