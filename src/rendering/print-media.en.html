<h3>Print media</h3>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow the user to request the opportunity to <dfn>obtain a physical
  form</dfn> (or a representation of a physical form) of a <code>Document</code>. For example,
  selecting the option to print a page or convert it to PDF format. <ref spec=PDF></p>

  <p>When the user actually <span data-x="obtain a physical form">obtains a physical form</span> (or
  a representation of a physical form) of a <code>Document</code>, the user agent is expected to
  create a new rendering of the <code>Document</code> for the print media.</p>
