  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a file upload control</h4>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span data-x="attr-input-type-file">File Upload</span> state is expected to render as an
  <span>'inline-block'</span> box containing a span of text giving the file name(s) of the <span
  data-x="concept-input-type-file-selected">selected files</span>, if any, followed by a button
  that, when activated, provides the user with a file picker from which the selection can be
  changed.</p>
