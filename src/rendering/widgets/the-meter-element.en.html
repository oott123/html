  <h4>The <code>meter</code> element</h4>

  <p>The <code>meter</code> element is expected to render as an <span>'inline-block'</span> box with
  a <span>'height'</span> of '1em' and a <span>'width'</span> of '5em', a
  <span>'vertical-align'</span> of '-0.2em', and with its contents depicting a gauge.</p>

  <p>When the element is wider than it is tall (or square), the depiction is expected to be of a
  horizontal gauge, with the minimum value on the right if the <span>'direction'</span> property on
  this element has a <span>computed value</span> of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise. When the
  element is taller than it is wide, it is expected to depict a vertical gauge, with the minimum
  value on the bottom.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to use a presentation consistent with platform conventions for gauges,
  if any.</p>

  <p class="note">Requirements for what must be depicted in the gauge are included in the definition
  of the <code>meter</code> element.</p>
