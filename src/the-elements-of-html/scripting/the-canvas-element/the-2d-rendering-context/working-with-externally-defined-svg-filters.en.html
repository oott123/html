<h6>Working with externally-defined SVG filters</h6>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Since drawing is performed using filter value 'none' until an externally-defined
  filter has finished loading, authors might wish to determine whether such a filter
  has finished loading before proceeding with a drawing operation. One way to accomplish
  this is to load the externally-defined filter elsewhere within the same page in some
  element that sends a <code data-x="">load</code> event (for example, an <span>SVG
  <code>use</code></span> element), and wait for the <code data-x="">load</code> event to be
  dispatched.</p>

  <div w-nodev>
