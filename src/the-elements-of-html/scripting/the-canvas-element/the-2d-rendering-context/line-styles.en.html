  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Objects that implement the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface have attributes and
  methods (defined in this section) that control how lines are treated by the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code></dfn> attribute gives the
  width of lines, in coordinate space units. On getting, it must return the current value. On
  setting, zero, negative, infinite, and NaN values must be ignored, leaving the value unchanged;
  other values must change the current value to the new value.</p>

  <p>When the object implementing the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface is created, the
  <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> attribute must initially have the value
  1.0.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code></dfn> attribute defines the type
  of endings that UAs will place on the end of lines. The three valid values are "<code
  data-x="">butt</code>", "<code data-x="">round</code>", and "<code
  data-x="">square</code>".</p>

  <p>On getting, it must return the current value. On setting, the current value must be changed
  to the new value.</p>

  <p>When the object implementing the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface is created, the
  <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code> attribute must initially have the value
  "<code data-x="">butt</code>".</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code></dfn> attribute defines the type
  of corners that UAs will place where two lines meet. The three valid values are
  "<code data-x="">bevel</code>", "<code data-x="">round</code>", and "<code data-x="">miter</code>".</p>

  <p>On getting, it must return the current value. On setting, the current value must be changed
  to the new value.</p>

  <p>When the object implementing the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface is created, the
  <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code> attribute must initially have the value
  "<code data-x="">miter</code>".</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code> attribute has the value "<code
  data-x="">miter</code>", strokes use the miter limit ratio to decide how to render joins. The
  miter limit ratio can be explicitly set using the <dfn><code
  data-x="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code></dfn> attribute. On getting, it must return
  the current value. On setting, zero, negative, infinite, and NaN values must be ignored, leaving
  the value unchanged; other values must change the current value to the new value.</p>
  <!-- values less than 1.0 are equivalent to 1.0, since it's compared against a ratio that can't be
       less than 1.0 -->

  <p>When the object implementing the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface is created, the
  <code data-x="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code> attribute must initially have the value
  10.0.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> object has a <dfn>dash list</dfn>, which is either
  empty or consists of an even number of non-negative numbers. Initially, the <span>dash list</span>
  must be empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-setLineDash">setLineDash()</code></dfn> method, when
  invoked, must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>a</var> be the argument.</p></li>

   <li><p>If any value in <var>a</var> is not finite (e.g. an Infinity or a NaN value), or
   if any value is negative (less than zero), then abort these steps (without throwing an exception;
   user agents could show a message on a developer console, though, as that would be helpful for
   debugging).</p></li>

   <li><p>If the number of elements in <var>a</var> is odd, then let <var>a</var>
   be the concatenation of two copies of <var>a</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the object's <span>dash list</span> be <var>a</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-getLineDash">getLineDash()</code></dfn> method is
  invoked, it must return a sequence whose values are the values of the object's <span>dash
  list</span>, in the same order.</p>

  <p>It is sometimes useful to change the "phase" of the dash pattern, e.g. to achieve a "marching
  ants" effect. The phase can be set using the <dfn><code
  data-x="dom-context-2d-lineDashOffset">lineDashOffset</code></dfn> attribute. On getting, it must
  return the current value. On setting, infinite and NaN values must be ignored, leaving the value
  unchanged; other values must change the current value to the new value.</p>

  <p>When the object implementing the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface is created, the
  <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineDashOffset">lineDashOffset</code> attribute must initially have
  the value 0.0.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>trace a path</dfn>, given an object <var>style</var>
  that implements the <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code> interface, it must run the following
  algorithm. This algorithm returns a new <span data-x="concept-path">path</span>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>path</var> be a copy of the path being traced.</p></li>

   <!-- PATH SANITIZATION -->

   <li><p>Prune all zero-length <span>line segments</span> from <var>path</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove from <var>path</var> any subpaths containing no lines (i.e. subpaths with
   just one point).</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace each point in each subpath of <var>path</var> other than the first point
   and the last point of each subpath by a <i>join</i> that joins the line leading to that point to
   the line leading out of that point, such that the subpaths all consist of two points (a starting
   point with a line leading out of it, and an ending point with a line leading into it), one or
   more lines (connecting the points and the joins), and zero or more joins (each connecting one
   line to another), connected together such that each subpath is a series of one or more lines with
   a join between each one and a point on each end.</p></li>

   <li><p>Add a straight closing line to each closed subpath in <var>path</var> connecting
   the last point and the first point of that subpath; change the last point to a join (from the
   previously last line to the newly added closing line), and change the first point to a join (from
   the newly added closing line to the first line).</p>

   <li><p>If the <var>styles</var> <span>dash list</span> is empty, then jump to the step
   labeled <i>convert</i>.</p></li>

   <!-- DASHING -->

   <li><p>Let <var>pattern width</var> be the concatenation of all the entries of the <var>styles</var> <span>dash list</span>, in coordinate space units.</p>

   <li><p>For each subpath <var>subpath</var> in <var>path</var>, run the
   following substeps. These substeps mutate the subpaths in <var>path</var> <i>in
   vivo</i>.</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var>subpath width</var> be the length of all the lines of <var>subpath</var>, in coordinate space units.</p>

     <li><p>Let <var>offset</var> be the value of the <var>styles</var> <code
     data-x="dom-context-2d-lineDashOffset">lineDashOffset</code>, in coordinate space
     units.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>While <var>offset</var> is greater than <var>pattern width</var>,
      decrement it by <var>pattern width</var>.</p>

      <p>While <var>offset</var> is less than zero, increment it by <var>pattern
      width</var>.</p>

     </li>

     <li><p>Define <var>L</var> to be a linear coordinate line defined along all lines in
     <var>subpath</var>, such that the start of the first line in the subpath is defined
     as coordinate 0, and the end of the last line in the subpath is defined as coordinate <var>subpath width</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>position</var> be zero minus <var>offset</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>index</var> be 0.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>current state</var> be <i>off</i> (the other states being <i>on</i>
     and <i>zero-on</i>).</p></li>

     <li><p><i>Dash on</i>: Let <var>segment length</var> be
     the value of the <var>styles</var> <span>dash
     list</span>'s <var>index</var>th entry.</p></li>

     <li><p>Increment <var>position</var> by <var>segment length</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>position</var> is greater than <var>subpath width</var>,
     then end these substeps for this subpath and start them again for the next subpath; if there
     are no more subpaths, then jump to the step labeled <i>convert</i> instead.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>segment length</var> is non-zero, then let <var>current state</var> be
     <i>on</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Increment <var>index</var> by one.</p></li>

     <li><p><i>Dash off<!-- labeled for consistency only --></i>: Let <var>segment
     length</var> be the value of the <var>styles</var> <span>dash list</span>'s <var>index</var>th entry.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>start</var> be the offset <var>position</var> on <var>L</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Increment <var>position</var> by <var>segment length</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>position</var> is less than zero, then jump to the step labeled
     <i>post-cut</i>.</p></li> <!-- start and end both before zero -->

     <li><p>If <var>start</var> is less than zero, then let <var>start</var> be
     zero.</p></li> <!-- end will be (at or) after zero -->

     <li><p>If <var>position</var> is greater than <var>subpath width</var>,
     then let <var>end</var> be the offset <var>subpath width</var> on <var>L</var>. Otherwise, let <var>end</var> be the offset <var>position</var> on <var>L</var>.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>Jump to the first appropriate step:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If <var>segment length</var> is zero and <var>current state</var> is
       <i>off</i></dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Do nothing, just continue to the next step.</p>

       </dd>


       <dt>If <var>current state</var> is <i>off</i></dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Cut the line on which <var>end</var> finds itself short at <var>end</var> and place a point there, cutting the subpath that it was in in two;
        remove all line segments, joins, points, and subpaths that are between <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>; and finally place a single point at <var>start</var> with no lines connecting to it.</p>

        <p>The point has a <i>directionality</i> for the purposes of drawing line caps (see below).
        The directionality is the direction that the original line had at that point (i.e. when <var>L</var> was defined above).</p>

       </dd>


       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Cut the line on which <var>start</var> finds itself into two at <var>start</var> and place a point there, cutting the subpath that it was in in two, and
        similarly cut the line on which <var>end</var> finds itself short at <var>end</var> and place a point there, cutting the subpath that <em>it</em> was in in
        two, and then remove all line segments, joins, points, and subpaths that are between <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>.</p>

        <p>If <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are the same point, then this
        results in just the line being cut in two and two points being inserted there, with nothing
        being removed, unless a join also happens to be at that point, in which case the join must
        be removed.</p>

       </dd>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <!-- STROKING -->

   <li>

    <p><i>Convert</i>: This is the step that converts the path to a new path that represents its
    stroke.</p>

    <p>Create a new <span data-x="concept-path">path</span> that describes the edge of the areas
    that would be covered if a straight line of length equal to the <var>styles</var>
    <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> was swept along each subpath in <var>path</var> while being kept at an angle such that the line is orthogonal to the path
    being swept, replacing each point with the end cap necessary to satisfy the <var>styles</var> <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code> attribute as
    described previously and elaborated below, and replacing each join with the join necessary to
    satisfy the <var>styles</var> <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code>
    type, as defined below.</p>

    <p><strong>Caps</strong>: Each point has a flat edge perpendicular to the direction of the line
    coming out of it. This is them augmented according to the value of the <var>styles</var> <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code>. The "<code
    data-x="">butt</code>" value means that no additional line cap is added. The "<code
    data-x="">round</code>" value means that a semi-circle with the diameter equal to the <var>styles</var> <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> width must
    additionally be placed on to the line coming out of each point. The "<code
    data-x="">square</code>" value means that a rectangle with the length of the <var>styles</var> <code data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> width and the
    width of half the <var>styles</var> <code
    data-x="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> width, placed flat against the edge
    perpendicular to the direction of the line coming out of the point, must be added at each
    point.</p>

    <p>Points with no lines coming out of them must have two caps placed back-to-back as if it was
    really two points connected to each other by an infinitesimally short straight line in the
    direction of the point's <i>directionality</i> (as defined above).</p>

    <p><strong>Joins</strong>: In addition to the point where a join occurs, two additional points
    are relevant to each join, one for each line: the two corners found half the line width away
    from the join point, one perpendicular to each line, each on the side furthest from the other
    line.</p>

    <p>A triangle connecting these two opposite corners with a straight line, with the third point
    of the triangle being the join point, must be added at all joins. The <code
    data-x="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code> attribute controls whether anything else is
    rendered. The three aforementioned values have the following meanings:</p>

    <p>The "<code data-x="">bevel</code>" value means that this is all that is rendered at
    joins.</p>

    <p>The "<code data-x="">round</code>" value means that an arc connecting the two aforementioned
    corners of the join, abutting (and not overlapping) the aforementioned triangle, with the
    diameter equal to the line width and the origin at the point of the join, must be added at
    joins.</p>

    <p>The "<code data-x="">miter</code>" value means that a second triangle must (if it can given
    the miter length) be added at the join, with one line being the line between the two
    aforementioned corners, abutting the first triangle, and the other two being continuations of
    the outside edges of the two joining lines, as long as required to intersect without going over
    the miter length.</p>

    <p>The miter length is the distance from the point where the join occurs to the intersection of
    the line edges on the outside of the join. The miter limit ratio is the maximum allowed ratio of
    the miter length to half the line width. If the miter length would cause the miter limit ratio
    (as set by the <var>style</var> <code
    data-x="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code> attribute) to be exceeded, then this second
    triangle must not be added.</p> <!-- the actual ratio can't possibly be less than 1.0 -->

<!-- here's a nice demo of the miter:
  c.clearRect(0, 0, 640, 480);
  c.beginPath();

  c.moveTo((new Date()/100) % 600, 100);
  c.lineTo(300, 300);
  c.lineTo(500, 300);

  c.lineWidth = 50;
  c.miterLimit = 10000;
  c.strokeStyle = 'silver'
  c.stroke();

  c.miterLimit = 0.0001;
  c.strokeStyle = 'black'
  c.stroke();

  c.lineWidth = 1;
  c.strokeStyle = 'red'
  c.stroke();
-->

    <p>The subpaths in the newly created path must be oriented such that for any point, the number
    of times a half-infinite straight line drawn from that point crosses a subpath is even if and
    only if the number of times a half-infinite straight line drawn from that same point crosses a
    subpath going in one direction is equal to the number of times it crosses a subpath going in the
    other direction.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return the newly created path.</p></li>
