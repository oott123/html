  <h3 split-filename="scripting">Scripting</h3>

  <p>Scripts allow authors to add interactivity to their documents.</p>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to use declarative alternatives to scripting where possible, as
  declarative mechanisms are often more maintainable, and many users disable scripting.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, instead of using script to show or hide a section to show more details, the
   <code>details</code> element could be used.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Authors are also encouraged to make their applications degrade gracefully in the absence of
  scripting support.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, if an author provides a link in a table header to dynamically resort the table,
   the link could also be made to function without scripts by requesting the sorted table from the
   server.</p>

  </div>
