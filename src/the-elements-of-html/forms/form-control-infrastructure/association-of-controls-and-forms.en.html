<h5>Association of controls and forms</h5>

  <p>A <span>form-associated element</span> can have a relationship with a <code>form</code>
  element, which is called the element's <dfn>form owner</dfn>. If a <span>form-associated
  element</span> is not associated with a <code>form</code> element, its <span>form owner</span> is
  said to be null.</p>

  <p>A <span>form-associated element</span> is, by default, associated with its <span
  w-nodev>nearest</span> ancestor <code>form</code> element<span w-nodev> (as described
  below)</span>, but, if it is <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span>, may have a <dfn><code
  data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code></dfn> attribute specified to override this.</p>

  <p class="note">This feature allows authors to work around the lack of support for nested
  <code>form</code> elements.</p>

  <p>If a <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span> <span>form-associated element</span> has a
  <code data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute specified, then that attribute's value must be
  the <span data-x="concept-id">ID</span> of a <code>form</code> element in the element's
  <span>tree</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p class="note">The rules in this section are complicated by the fact that although conforming
  documents or <span data-x="tree">trees</span> will never contain nested <code>form</code>
  elements, it is quite possible (e.g., using a script that performs DOM manipulation) to generate
  <span data-x="tree">trees</span> that have such nested elements. They are also complicated by
  rules in the HTML parser that, for historical reasons, can result in a <span>form-associated
  element</span> being associated with a <code>form</code> element that is not its ancestor.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> is created, its <span>form owner</span> must be
  initialized to null (no owner).</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> is to be <dfn
  data-x="concept-form-association">associated</dfn> with a form, its <span>form owner</span> must
  be set to that form.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> or one of its ancestors <span>becomes
  connected</span>, then the user agent must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that
  <span>form-associated element</span>. <span class="note">The <span>HTML parser</span> overrides
  this requirement when inserting form controls.</span></p>

  <p>When an element changes its parent node resulting in a <span>form-associated element</span> and
  its <span>form owner</span> (if any) no longer being in the same <span>tree</span>, then the user
  agent must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that <span>form-associated element</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span> <span>form-associated element</span>'s
  <code data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is set, changed, or removed, then the user
  agent must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that element.</p>

  <p>When a <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span> <span>form-associated element</span> has a
  <code data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute and the <span data-x="concept-id">ID</span> of
  any of the elements in the <span>tree</span> changes, then the user agent must <span>reset the
  form owner</span> of that <span>form-associated element</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span> <span>form-associated element</span> has a
  <code data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute and an element with an <span
  data-x="concept-id">ID</span> is <span data-x="node is inserted into a document">inserted
  into</span> or <span data-x="node is removed from a document">removed from</span> the
  <code>Document</code>, then the user agent must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that
  <span>form-associated element</span>.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>reset the form owner</dfn> of a <span>form-associated
  element</span> <var>element</var>, it must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>
    <p>If all of the following conditions are true

    <ul class="brief">
     <li><var>element</var>'s <span>form owner</span> is not null
     <li><var>element</var> is not <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span> or its <code
     data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> content attribute is not present
     <li><var>element</var>'s <span>form owner</span> is its nearest <code>form</code> element
     ancestor after the change to the ancestor chain
    </ul>

    <p>then do nothing, and abort these steps.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Set <var>element</var>'s <span>form owner</span> to null.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>If <var>element</var> is <span data-x="category-listed">listed</span>, has a <code
    data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> content attribute, and is <span>connected</span>, then run
    this substep:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>If the first element in <var>element</var>'s <span>tree</span>, in <span>tree
     order</span>, to have an <span data-x="concept-id">ID</span> that is <span
     data-x="case-sensitive">case-sensitively</span> equal to <var>element</var>'s <code
     data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> content attribute's value, is a <code>form</code> element,
     then <span data-x="concept-form-association">associate</span> the <var>element</var> with that
     <code>form</code> element.</p></li>
     <!-- note that this ignores the name="" attribute and is unaffected by quirks mode (it's always
          case sensitive) -->
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var>element</var> has an ancestor <code>form</code> element, then <span
   data-x="concept-form-association">associate</span> <var>element</var> with the nearest such
   ancestor <code>form</code> element.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following non-conforming snippet:</p>

   <pre class="bad">...
 &lt;form id="a">
  &lt;div id="b">&lt;/div>
 &lt;/form>
 &lt;script>
  document.getElementById('b').innerHTML =
     '&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;/form>&lt;form id="c">&lt;input id="d">&lt;/table>' +
     '&lt;input id="e">';
 &lt;/script>
...</pre>

   <p>The <span>form owner</span> of "d" would be the inner nested form "c", while the <span>form
   owner</span> of "e" would be the outer form "a".</p>

   <p>This happens as follows: First, the "e" node gets associated with "c" in the <span>HTML
   parser</span>. Then, the <code data-x="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code> algorithm moves the nodes
   from the temporary document to the "b" element. At this point, the nodes see their ancestor chain
   change, and thus all the "magic" associations done by the parser are reset to normal ancestor
   associations.</p>

   <p>This example is a non-conforming document, though, as it is a violation of the content models
   to nest <code>form</code> elements, and there is a <span>parse error</span> for the <code
   data-x="">&lt;/form></code> tag.</p>
