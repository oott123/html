  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text, buttons, checkboxes,
  range, or color picker controls. A user can interact with such a form, providing data that can
  then be sent to the server for further processing (e.g. returning the results of a search or
  calculation). No client-side scripting is needed in many cases, though an API is available so that
  scripts can augment the user experience or use forms for purposes other than submitting data to a
  server.</p>

  <p>Writing a form consists of several steps, which can be performed in any order: writing the user
  interface, implementing the server-side processing, and configuring the user interface to
  communicate with the server.</p>
