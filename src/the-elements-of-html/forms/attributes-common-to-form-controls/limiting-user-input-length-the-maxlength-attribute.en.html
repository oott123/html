<h5>Limiting user input length: the <code data-x="attr-fe-maxlength">maxlength</code> attribute</h5>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="attr-fe-maxlength">form control <code data-x="">maxlength</code> attribute</dfn>,
  controlled by a <var>dirty value flag</var>, declares a limit on the number of characters
  a user can input. The "number of characters" is measured using <span>code-unit length</span> and,
  in the case of <code>textarea</code> elements, with all line breaks normalized to a single
  character (as opposed to CRLF pairs).</p>

  <p>If an element has its <span data-x="attr-fe-maxlength">form control <code
  data-x="">maxlength</code> attribute</span> specified, the attribute's value must be a <span>valid
  non-negative integer</span>. If the attribute is specified and applying the <span>rules for
  parsing non-negative integers</span> to its value results in a number, then that number is the
  element's <dfn>maximum allowed value length</dfn>. If the attribute is omitted or parsing its
  value results in an error, then there is no <span>maximum allowed value length</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If an element has a <span>maximum allowed value
  length</span>, its <var>dirty value flag</var> is true, its <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> was last changed by a user edit (as opposed to a change made
  by a script), and the <span>code-unit length</span> of the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-api-value">API value</span> is greater than the element's <span>maximum allowed
  value length</span>, then the element is <span>suffering from being too long</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents may prevent the user from causing the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-api-value">API value</span> to be set to a value whose <span>code-unit
  length</span> is greater than the element's <span>maximum allowed value length</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">In the case of <code>textarea</code> elements, the <span
  data-x="concept-fe-api-value">API value</span> and <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>
  differ. In particular, the <span>textarea line break normalization transformation</span> is
  applied before the <span>maximum allowed value length</span> is checked (whereas the
  <span>textarea wrapping transformation</span> is not applied).</p>
