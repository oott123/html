  <h6><dfn id="number-state" data-x="attr-input-type-number">Number</dfn> state (<code data-x="">type=number</code>)</h6>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element's <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span data-x="attr-input-type-number">Number</span> state, the rules in this section apply.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <code>input</code> element <span>represents</span> a control for setting the element's
  <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> to a string representing a number.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>If the element is <i data-x="concept-fe-mutable">mutable</i>, the user agent should allow the
  user to change the number represented by its <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>, as
  obtained from applying the <span>rules for parsing floating-point number values</span> to it. User
  agents must not allow the user to set the <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> to a
  non-empty string that is not a <span>valid floating-point number</span>. If the user agent
  provides a user interface for selecting a number, then the <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> must be set to the <span data-x="best representation of the
  number as a floating-point number">best representation of the number representing the user's
  selection as a floating-point number</span>. User agents should allow the user to set the <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> to the empty string.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface describes input that the user
  agent cannot convert to a <span>valid floating-point number</span>, the control is <span>suffering
  from bad input</span>.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">This specification does not define what user interface user agents are to use;
  user agent vendors are encouraged to consider what would best serve their users' needs. For
  example, a user agent in Persian or Arabic markets might support Persian and Arabic numeric input
  (converting it to the format required for submission as described above). Similarly, a user agent
  designed for Romans might display the value in Roman numerals rather than in decimal; or (more
  realistically) a user agent designed for the French market might display the value with
  apostrophes between thousands and commas before the decimals, and allow the user to enter a value
  in that manner, internally converting it to the submission format described above.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, if specified and not empty, must
  have a value that is a <span>valid floating-point number</span>.</p> <!-- ok to set out-of-range
  value, we never know when we might have to represent bogus input -->

  <div w-nodev>

  <p><strong>The <span>value sanitization algorithm</span> is as follows</strong>: If the <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element is not a <span>valid floating-point
  number</span>, then set it to the empty string instead.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is
  a <span>valid floating-point number</span>. The <code data-x="attr-input-max">max</code> attribute,
  if specified, must have a value that is a <span>valid floating-point number</span>.</p>

  <p><span w-nodev>The <span data-x="concept-input-step-scale">step scale factor</span> is
  1.</span> The <span data-x="concept-input-step-default">default step</span> is 1 (allowing only
  integers to be selected by the user, unless the <span data-x="concept-input-min-zero">step
  base</span> has a non-integer value).</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>When the element is <span>suffering from a step mismatch</span>, the user agent may round the
  element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> to the nearest number for which the element
  would not <span data-x="suffering from a step mismatch">suffer from a step mismatch</span>. If
  there are two such numbers, user agents are encouraged to pick the one nearest positive
  infinity.</p>

  <p><strong>The <span data-x="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a string to a
  number</span>, given a string <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>: If applying the
  <span>rules for parsing floating-point number values</span> to <var>input</var> results
  in an error, then return an error; otherwise, return the resulting number.</p>

  <p><strong>The <span data-x="concept-input-value-number-string">algorithm to convert a number to a
  string</span>, given a number <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>: Return a
  <span>valid floating-point number</span> that represents <var>input</var>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is an example of using a numeric input control:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>How much do you want to charge? $&lt;input type=number min=0 step=0.01 name=price>&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>As described above, a user agent might support numeric input in the user's local format,
   converting it to the format required for submission as described above. This might include
   handling grouping separators (as in "872,000,000,000") and various decimal separators (such as
   "3,99" vs "3.99") or using local digits (such as those in Arabic, Devanagari, Persian, and
   Thai).</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">The <code data-x="">type=number</code> state is not appropriate for input that
  happens to only consist of numbers but isn't strictly speaking a number. For example, it would be
  inappropriate for credit card numbers or US postal codes. A simple way of determining whether to
  use <code data-x="">type=number</code> is to consider whether it would make sense for the input
  control to have a spinbox interface (e.g. with "up" and "down" arrows). Getting a credit card
  number wrong by 1 in the last digit isn't a minor mistake, it's as wrong as getting every digit
  incorrect. So it would not make sense for the user to select a credit card number using "up" and
  "down" buttons. When a spinbox interface is not appropriate, <code data-x="">type=text</code> is
  probably the right choice (possibly with a <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute).</p>
