  <h6>The <code data-x="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code></dfn> attribute is a <span>boolean
  attribute</span> that indicates whether the user is to be allowed to specify more than one
  value.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following extract shows how an e-mail client's "To" field could accept multiple e-mail
   addresses.</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>To: &lt;input type=email multiple name=to>&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>If the user had, amongst many friends in their user contacts database, two friends
   "Spider-Man" (with address "spider@parker.example.net") and "Scarlet Witch" (with address
   "scarlet@avengers.example.net"), then, after the user has typed "<kbd>s</kbd>", the user agent
   might suggest these two e-mail addresses to the user.</p>

   <!-- Having alternative text in the following image would be bogus and non-conforming use of
   HTML, since the image is redundant with the previous paragraph. In particular, just describing
   the image would be especially bad for accessibility as it would be disorienting, there having
   been no mention that an image is present. -->
   <p><img src="/images/sample-email-1.svg" width="330" height="100" alt=""></p>

   <p>The page could also link in the user's contacts database from the site:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>To: &lt;input type=email multiple name=to list=contacts>&lt;/label>
...
&lt;datalist id="contacts">
 &lt;option value="hedral@damowmow.com">
 &lt;option value="pillar@example.com">
 &lt;option value="astrophy@cute.example">
 &lt;option value="astronomy@science.example.org">
&lt;/datalist></pre>

   <p>Suppose the user had entered "<kbd>bob@example.net</kbd>" into this text control, and then
   started typing a second e-mail address starting with "<kbd>s</kbd>". The user agent might show
   both the two friends mentioned earlier, as well as the "astrophy" and "astronomy" values given in
   the <code>datalist</code> element.</p>

   <!-- As above, having a non-empty alt="" attribute on the following image would be dumb, which is
   why it's left blank. The pertinent parts of the image are already described in the prose, and the
   non-pertinent parts aren't relevant to users who can't see the image, obviously. -->

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following extract shows how an e-mail client's "Attachments" field could accept multiple
   files for upload.</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>Attachments: &lt;input type=file multiple name=att>&lt;/label></pre>

  </div>
