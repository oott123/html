  <h5 id="common-input-element-events">Common event behaviors</h5>

  <p>When the <code data-x="event-input">input</code> and <code
  data-x="event-change">change</code> events <span data-x="concept-input-apply">apply</span>
  (which is the case for all <code>input</code> controls other than <span
  data-x="concept-button">buttons</span> and those with the <code
  data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute in the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-hidden">Hidden</span> state), the events are fired to indicate that the
  user has interacted with the control. The <code data-x="event-input">input</code> event fires
  whenever the user has modified the data of the control. The <code
  data-x="event-change">change</code> event fires when the value is committed, if that makes sense
  for the control, or else when the control <a href="#unfocus-causes-change-event">loses focus</a>.
  In all cases, the <code data-x="event-input">input</code> event comes before the corresponding
  <code data-x="event-change">change</code> event (if any).</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element has a defined <span>input activation behavior</span>, the
  rules for dispatching these events, if they <span data-x="concept-input-apply">apply</span>, are
  given in the section above that defines the <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's
  state. (This is the case for all <code>input</code> controls with the <code
  data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute in the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-checkbox">Checkbox</span> state, the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-radio">Radio Button</span> state, or the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-file">File Upload</span> state.)</p>

  <p>For <code>input</code> elements without a defined <span>input activation behavior</span>, but
  to which these events <span data-x="concept-input-apply">apply</span>, and for which the user
  interface involves both interactive manipulation and an explicit commit action, then when the user
  changes the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>, the user agent must
  <span>queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-input">input</code> at the <code>input</code> element, with the <code
  data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> attribute initialized to true, and any time the user
  commits the change, the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span
  data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code data-x="event-change">change</code>
  at the <code>input</code> element, with the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code>
  attribute initialized to true.</p>

  <p class="example">An example of a user interface involving both interactive manipulation and a
  commit action would be a <span data-x="attr-input-type-range">Range</span> controls that use a
  slider, when manipulated using a pointing device. While the user is dragging the control's knob,
  <code data-x="event-input">input</code> events would fire whenever the position changed,
  whereas the <code data-x="event-change">change</code> event would only fire when the user
  let go of the knob, committing to a specific value.</p>

  <p>For <code>input</code> elements without a defined <span>input activation behavior</span>, but
  to which these events <span data-x="concept-input-apply">apply</span>, and for which the user
  interface involves an explicit commit action but no intermediate manipulation, then any time the
  user commits a change to the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>, the user
  agent must <span>queue a task</span> to first <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an
  event</span> named <code data-x="event-input">input</code> at the <code>input</code> element, with
  the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> attribute initialized to true, and then <span
  data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code data-x="event-change">change</code>
  at the <code>input</code> element, with the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code>
  attribute initialized to true.</p>

  <p class="example">An example of a user interface with a commit action would be a <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-color">Color</span> control that consists of a single button that brings
  up a color wheel: if the <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> only changes when the dialog
  is closed, then that would be the explicit commit action. On the other hand, if manipulating the
  control changes the color interactively, then there might be no commit action.</p>

  <p class="example">Another example of a user interface with a commit action would be a <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-date">Date</span> control that allows both text-based user input and user
  selection from a drop-down calendar: while text input might not have an explicit commit step,
  selecting a date from the drop down calendar and then dismissing the drop down would be a commit
  action.</p>

  <p>For <code>input</code> elements without a defined <span>input activation behavior</span>, but
  to which these events <span data-x="concept-input-apply">apply</span>, any time the user causes
  the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> to change without an explicit commit
  action, the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an
  event</span> named <code data-x="event-input">input</code> at the <code>input</code> element, with
  the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> attribute initialized to true. The
  corresponding <code data-x="event-change">change</code> event, if any, will be fired when
  the control <a href="#unfocus-causes-change-event">loses focus</a>.</p>

  <p class="example">Examples of a user changing the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> would include the user typing into a text control, pasting
  a new value into the control, or undoing an edit in that control. Some user interactions do not
  cause changes to the value, e.g., hitting the "delete" key in an empty text control, or replacing
  some text in the control with text from the clipboard that happens to be exactly the same
  text.</p>

  <p class="example">A <span data-x="attr-input-type-range">Range</span> control in the form of a
  slider that the user has <span>focused</span> and is interacting with using a keyboard would be
  another example of the user changing the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>
  without a commit step.</p>

  <p>In the case of <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that just fire an <code
  data-x="event-input">input</code> event, user agents may wait for a suitable break in the
  user's interaction before <span data-x="queue a task">queuing</span> the tasks; for example, a
  user agent could wait for the user to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event
  when the user pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke. <!-- similar text is present in
  the <textarea> section -->

  <p>When the user agent is to change an <code>input</code> element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> on behalf of the user (e.g. as part of a form prefilling
  feature), the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to first update the <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> accordingly, then <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an
  event</span> named <code data-x="event-input">input</code> at the <code>input</code> element, with
  the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> attribute initialized to true, then <span
  data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code data-x="event-change">change</code>
  at the <code>input</code> element, with the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code>
  attribute initialized to true.</p>

  <p class="note">These events are not fired in response to changes made to the values of form
  controls by scripts. (This is to make it easier to update the values of form controls in response
  to the user manipulating the controls, without having to then filter out the script's own changes
  to avoid an infinite loop.)</p>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for these <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> is the
  <span>user interaction task source</span>.</p>
