  <h4>Links created by <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements</h4>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code></dfn> attribute on <code>a</code> and
  <code>area</code> elements must have a value that is a <span>valid URL potentially surrounded by
  spaces</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute on <code>a</code> and
  <code>area</code> elements is not required; when those elements do not have <code
  data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attributes they do not create hyperlinks.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code></dfn> attribute, if present, must be
  a <span>valid browsing context name or keyword</span>. It gives the name of the <span>browsing
  context</span> that will be used. <span w-nodev>User agents use this name when
  <span>following hyperlinks</span>.</span></p>

  <p>When an <code>a</code> or <code>area</code> element's <span>activation behavior</span> is
  invoked, the user agent may allow the user to indicate a preference regarding whether the
  hyperlink is to be used for <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span> or whether the resource it
  specifies is to be downloaded.</p>

  <p>In the absence of a user preference, the default should be navigation if the element has no
  <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code> attribute, and should be to download the
  specified resource if it does.</p>

  <p>Whether determined by the user's preferences or via the presence or absence of the attribute,
  if the decision is to use the hyperlink for <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span> then the user
  agent must <span data-x="following hyperlinks">follow the hyperlink</span>, and if the decision is
  to use the hyperlink to download a resource, the user agent must <span data-x="downloading
  hyperlinks">download the hyperlink</span>. These terms are defined in subsequent sections
  below.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code></dfn> attribute, if present,
  indicates that the author intends the hyperlink to be used for <span data-x="downloading
  hyperlinks">downloading a resource</span>. The attribute may have a value; the value, if any,
  specifies the default file name that the author recommends for use in labeling the resource in a
  local file system. There are no restrictions on allowed values, but authors are cautioned that
  most file systems have limitations with regard to what punctuation is supported in file names,
  and user agents are likely to adjust file names accordingly.</p>


  <p>The <dfn id="ping" data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping"><code>ping</code></dfn> attribute, if present,
  gives the URLs of the resources that are interested in being notified if the user follows the
  hyperlink. The value must be a <span>set of space-separated tokens</span>, each of which must be a
  <span>valid non-empty URL</span> whose <span data-x="concept-url-scheme">scheme</span> is an
  <span>HTTP(S) scheme</span>. <span w-nodev>The value is used by the user agent for <span>hyperlink
  auditing</span>.</span></p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code></dfn> attribute on <code>a</code> and
  <code>area</code> elements controls what kinds of links the elements create. The attribute's value
  must be a <span>set of space-separated tokens</span>. The <a href="#linkTypes">allowed keywords
  and their meanings</a> are defined below.</p>

  <p><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>'s
  <span data-x="concept-supported-tokens">supported tokens</span> are the keywords defined in
  <a href="#linkTypes">HTML link types</a> which are allowed on <code>a</code> and
  <code>area</code> elements, impact the processing model, and are supported by the user agent. The
  possible <span data-x="concept-supported-tokens">supported tokens</span> are
  <code data-x="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> and
  <code data-x="rel-noopener">noopener</code>.
  <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>'s
  <span data-x="concept-supported-tokens">supported tokens</span> must only include the tokens from
  this list that the user agent implements the processing model for.</p>

  <p>Other specifications may add <a href="#linkTypes">HTML link types</a> as
  defined in <a href="#other-link-types">Other link types</a>. These specifications may require
  that their link types be included in <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>'s supported
  tokens.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code> attribute has no default value. If the
  attribute is omitted or if none of the values in the attribute are recognized by the user agent,
  then the document has no particular relationship with the destination resource other than there
  being a hyperlink between the two.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code></dfn> attribute on
  <code>a</code> elements that create <span data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span>, if present, gives
  the language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory. The value must be a valid BCP 47
  language tag. <ref spec=BCP47> <span w-nodev>User agents must not consider this attribute
  authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the resource, user agents must use only language information
  associated with the resource to determine its language, not metadata included in the link to the
  resource.</span></p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code></dfn> attribute, if present, gives the
  <span>MIME type</span> of the linked resource. It is purely advisory. The value must be a
  <span>valid MIME type</span>. <span w-nodev>User agents must not consider the <code
  data-x="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attribute authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the
  resource, user agents must not use metadata included in the link to the resource to determine its
  type.</span></p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hyperlink-referrerpolicy">referrerpolicy</code></dfn> attribute
  is a <span>referrer policy attribute</span>. Its purpose is to set the <span>referrer policy</span>
  used when <span>following hyperlinks</span>. <ref spec=REFERRERPOLICY></p>
