<h5>Link type "<dfn><code data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code> keyword may be used with <code>link</code>
  elements. This keyword creates an <span data-x="external resource link">external resource
  link</span>. This keyword is <span>body-ok</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code> keyword indicates that preemptively
  initiating a connection to the <span>origin</span> of the specified resource is likely to be
  beneficial, as it is highly likely that the user will require resources located at that
  <span>origin</span>, and the user experience would be improved by preempting the latency costs
  associated with establishing the connection. <span w-nodev>User agents must implement the
  processing model of the <code data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code> keyword described in
  <cite>Resource Hints</cite>.</span> <ref spec=RESOURCEHINTS></p>

  <p>There is no default type for resources given by the <code
  data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code> keyword.</p>
