<h5>Other link types</h5>

  <p><dfn data-x="concept-rel-extensions">Extensions to the predefined set of link types</dfn> may be
  registered in the <a
  href="http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values#HTML5_link_type_extensions">microformats
  wiki existing-rel-values page</a>. <ref spec=MFREL></p>

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the <span data-x="">microformats wiki existing-rel-values page</span> at
  any time to add a type. Extension types must be specified with the following information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The actual value being defined. The value should not be confusingly similar to any other
    defined value (e.g. differing only in case).</p>

    <p>If the value contains a U+003A COLON character (:), it must also be an <span>absolute
    URL</span>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Effect on... <code>link</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Not allowed</dt>

     <dd>The keyword must not be specified on <code>link</code> elements.</dd>

     <dt>Hyperlink</dt>

     <dd>The keyword may be specified on a <code>link</code> element; it creates a
     <span>hyperlink</span>.</dd>

     <dt>External Resource</dt>

     <dd>The keyword may be specified on a <code>link</code> element; it creates an <span>external
     resource link</span>.</dd>

    </dl>

   </dd>


   <dt>Effect on... <code>a</code> and <code>area</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Not allowed</dt>

     <dd>The keyword must not be specified on <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements.</dd>

     <dt>Hyperlink</dt>

     <dd>The keyword may be specified on <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements; it creates a
     <span>hyperlink</span>.</dd>

     <dt>External Resource</dt>

     <dd>The keyword may be specified on <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements; it creates
     an <span>external resource link</span>.</dd>

     <dt>Hyperlink Annotation</dt>

     <dd>The keyword may be specified on <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements; it <span
     data-x="hyperlink annotation">annotates</span> other <span data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span>
     created by the element.</dd>

    </dl>

   </dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short non-normative description of what the keyword's meaning is.</p></dd>


   <dt>Specification</dt>

   <dd><p>A link to a more detailed description of the keyword's semantics and requirements. It
   could be another page on the Wiki, or a link to an external page.</p></dd>


   <dt>Synonyms</dt>

   <dd><p>A list of other keyword values that have exactly the same processing requirements. Authors
   should not use the values defined to be synonyms, they are only intended to allow user agents to
   support legacy content. Anyone may remove synonyms that are not used in practice; only names that
   need to be processed as synonyms for compatibility with legacy content are to be registered in
   this way.</p></dd>


   <dt>Status</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Proposed</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has not received wide peer review and approval. Someone has proposed it and is,
     or soon will be, using it.</dd>

     <dt>Ratified</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has received wide peer review and approval. It has a specification that
     unambiguously defines how to handle pages that use the keyword, including when they use it in
     incorrect ways.</dd>

     <dt>Discontinued</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has received wide peer review and it has been found wanting. Existing pages are
     using this keyword, but new pages should avoid it. The "brief description" and "specification"
     entries will give details of what authors should use instead, if anything.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>If a keyword is found to be redundant with existing values, it should be removed and listed
    as a synonym for the existing value.</p>

    <p>If a keyword is registered in the "proposed" state for a period of a month or more without
    being used or specified, then it may be removed from the registry.</p>

    <p>If a keyword is added with the "proposed" status and found to be redundant with existing
    values, it should be removed and listed as a synonym for the existing value. If a keyword is
    added with the "proposed" status and found to be harmful, then it should be changed to
    "discontinued" status.</p>

    <p>Anyone can change the status at any time, but should only do so in accordance with the
    definitions above.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Conformance checkers must use the information given on the <span data-x="">microformats wiki
  existing-rel-values page</span> to establish if a value is allowed or not: values defined in this
  specification or marked as "proposed" or "ratified" must be accepted when used on the elements for
  which they apply as described in the "Effect on..." field, whereas values marked as "discontinued"
  or not listed in either this specification or on the aforementioned page must be rejected as
  invalid. Conformance checkers may cache this information (e.g. for performance reasons or to avoid
  the use of unreliable network connectivity).</p>

  <p>When an author uses a new type not defined by either this specification or the Wiki page,
  conformance checkers should offer to add the value to the Wiki, with the details described above,
  with the "proposed" status.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Types defined as extensions in the <a
  href="http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values#HTML5_link_type_extensions">microformats
  wiki existing-rel-values page</a> with the status "proposed" or "ratified" may be used with the
  <code data-x="">rel</code> attribute on <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements in accordance to the "Effect on..." field. <ref spec=MFREL></p>
