<h6>Link type "<dfn><code data-x="rel-next">next</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-next">next</code> keyword may be used with <code>link</code>,
  <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code> elements. This keyword creates a <span>hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-next">next</code> keyword indicates that the document is part of a
  sequence, and that the link is leading to the document that is the next logical document in the
  sequence.</p>

  <p w-nodev>When the <code data-x="rel-next">next</code> keyword is used with a <code>link</code>
  element, user agents should implement one of the processing models described in <cite>Resource
  Hints</cite>, i.e. should process such links as if they were using one of the <code
  data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code>, <code data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code>,
  <code data-x="rel-prefetch">prefetch</code>, or <code data-x="rel-prerender">prerender</code>
  keywords. Which resource hint the user agent wishes to use is implementation-dependent; for
  example, a user agent may wish to use the less-costly <code
  data-x="rel-preconnect">preconnect</code> hint when trying to conserve data, battery power, or
  processing power, or may wish to pick a resource hint depending on heuristic analysis of past
  user behavior in similar scenarios. <ref spec="RESOURCEHINTS"></p>
