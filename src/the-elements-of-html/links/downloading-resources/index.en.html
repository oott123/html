<h4>Downloading resources</h4>

  <p>In some cases, resources are intended for later use rather than immediate viewing. To indicate
  that a resource is intended to be downloaded for use later, rather than immediately used, the
  <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code> attribute can be specified on the
  <code>a</code> or <code>area</code> element that creates the <span>hyperlink</span> to that
  resource.</p>

  <p>The attribute can furthermore be given a value, to specify the file name that user agents are
  to use when storing the resource in a file system. This value can be overridden by the `<code
  data-x="http-content-disposition">Content-Disposition</code>` HTTP header's filename parameters.
  <ref spec=RFC6266></p>

  <p>In cross-origin situations, the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code>
  attribute has to be combined with the `<code
  data-x="http-content-disposition">Content-Disposition</code>` HTTP header, specifically with the
  <code data-x="">attachment</code> disposition type, to avoid the user being warned of possibly
  nefarious activity. (This is to protect users from being made to download sensitive personal or
  confidential information without their full understanding.)</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When a user <dfn data-x="downloading hyperlinks">downloads a hyperlink</dfn> created by an
  element <var>subject</var>, optionally with a <var>hyperlink suffix</var>, the user agent must
  run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span data-x="parse a url">Parse</span> the <span>URL</span> given by
   <var>subject</var>'s <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute, relative to
   <var>subject</var>'s <span>node document</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <span data-x="parse a url">parsing</span> the <span>URL</span> fails, the user agent
   may report the error to the user in a user-agent-specific manner, may
   <span>navigate</span><!--DONAV download error--> to an error page to report the error, or may
   ignore the error and do nothing. In either case, the user agent must abort these steps.</p>

   <li><p>Otherwise, let <var>URL</var> be the <span>resulting URL string</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is a <var>hyperlink suffix</var>, append it to <var>URL</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return to whatever algorithm invoked these steps and continue
   these steps <span>in parallel</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>request</var> be a new <span data-x="concept-request">request</span> whose
   <span data-x="concept-request-url">url</span> is <var>URL</var>,
   <span data-x="concept-request-client">client</span> is <span>entry settings object</span>,
   <span data-x="concept-request-initiator">initiator</span> is "<code data-x="">download</code>",
   <span data-x="concept-request-destination">destination</span> is the empty string, and whose
   <span>omit-<code>Origin</code>-header flag</span>, <span>synchronous flag</span>, and
   <span>use-URL-credentials flag</span> are all set.

   <!--FETCH--><li><p>Handle the result of <span data-x="concept-fetch">fetching</span>
   <var>request</var> <span>as a download</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When a user agent is to handle a resource obtained from a fetch <dfn>as a download</dfn>, it
  should provide the user with a way to save the resource for later use, if a resource is
  successfully obtained; or otherwise should report any problems downloading the file to the
  user.</p>

  <p>If the user agent needs a file name for a resource being handled <span>as a download</span>, it
  should select one using the following algorithm.</p>

  <p class="warning">This algorithm is intended to mitigate security dangers involved in downloading
  files from untrusted sites, and user agents are strongly urged to follow it.</p> <!-- but it's
  optional, since it's not really an interoperability issue -->

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>filename</var> be the void value.</p></li>

   <!-- Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="" is always honoured, even cross-origin -->
   <li><p>If the resource has a `<code data-x="http-content-disposition">Content-Disposition</code>`
   header, that header specifies the <code data-x="">attachment</code> disposition type, and the
   header includes file name information, then let <var>filename</var> have the value
   specified by the header, and jump to the step labeled <i>sanitize</i> below. <ref spec=RFC6266></p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>interface origin</var> be the <span>origin</span> of the
   <code>Document</code> in which the <span data-x="downloading hyperlinks">download</span> or
   <span>navigate</span> action resulting in the download was initiated, if any.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>resource origin</var> be the <span>origin</span> of the URL of the
   resource being downloaded, unless that URL's <span data-x="concept-url-scheme">scheme</span>
   component is <code data-x="">data</code>, in which case let <var>resource origin</var> be
   the same as the <var>interface origin</var>, if any.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is no <var>interface origin</var>, then let <var>trusted

   origin</var>, and false otherwise.</p></li>

   <!-- Content-Disposition: *; filename="" overrides download="" for same-origin -->
   <li><p>If <var>trusted operation</var> is true and the resource has a `<code

   name information, then let <var>filename</var> have the value specified by the header,
   and jump to the step labeled <i>sanitize</i> below. <ref spec=RFC6266></p></li>

   <li><p>If the download was not initiated from a <span>hyperlink</span> created by an
   <code>a</code> or <code>area</code> element, or if the element of the <span>hyperlink</span> from

   attribute when the download was initiated, or if there was such an attribute but its value when

   <!-- download="" works for all links when same-origin -->
   <!-- it is not used cross-origin, though, even for explicit user gestures -->
   <!-- (except... see next step) -->
   <li><p>If <var>trusted operation</var> is true, let <var>filename</var> have

   <!-- fallback for same-origin resources or explicit downloads: use the resource's file name -->
   <li><p><i>No proposed file name</i>: If <var>trusted operation</var> is true, or if the

   <!-- no C-D: a header on cross-origin raises red flags -->
   <li>

    <p>Act in a user-agent-defined manner to safeguard the user from a potentially hostile
    cross-origin download. If the download is not to be aborted, then let <var>filename</var> be set to the user's preferred file name or to a file name selected by
    the user agent, and jump to the step labeled <i>sanitize</i> below.</p>

    <div class="warning">

     <p>If the algorithm reaches this step, then a download was begun from a different origin than
     the resource being downloaded, and the origin did not mark the file as suitable for
     downloading, and the download was not initiated by the user. This could be because a <code
     data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code> attribute was used to trigger the download, or
     because the resource in question is not of a type that the user agent supports.</p>

     <p>This could be dangerous, because, for instance, a hostile server could be trying to get a
     user to unknowingly download private information and then re-upload it to the hostile server,
     by tricking the user into thinking the data is from the hostile server.</p>

     <p>Thus, it is in the user's interests that the user be somehow notified that the resource in
     question comes from quite a different source, and to prevent confusion, any suggested file name
     from the potentially hostile <var>interface origin</var> should be ignored.</p>

    </div>

   </li>

   <li><p><i>Sanitize</i>: Optionally, allow the user to influence <var>filename</var>. For
   example, a user agent could prompt the user for a file name, potentially providing the value of
   <var>filename</var> as determined above as a default value.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Adjust <var>filename</var> to be suitable for the local file system.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, this could involve removing characters that are not legal in
    file names, or trimming leading and trailing whitespace.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the platform conventions do not in any way use <span
   data-x="concept-extension">extensions</span> to determine the types of file on the file system,
   then return <var>filename</var> as the file name and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>claimed type</var> be the type given by the resource's <span
   data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span>, if any is known. Let <var>named
   type</var> be the type given by <var>filename</var>'s <span
   data-x="concept-extension">extension</span>, if any is known. For the purposes of this step, a
   <i>type</i> is a mapping of a <span>MIME type</span> to an <span
   data-x="concept-extension">extension</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>named type</var> is consistent with the user's preferences (e.g. because
   the value of <var>filename</var> was determined by prompting the user), then return <var>filename</var> as the file name and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>claimed type</var> and <var>named type</var> are the same type
   (i.e. the type given by the resource's <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> is
   consistent with the type given by <var>filename</var>'s <span
   data-x="concept-extension">extension</span>), then return <var>filename</var> as the file
   name and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <var>claimed type</var> is known, then alter <var>filename</var> to
    add an <span data-x="concept-extension">extension</span> corresponding to <var>claimed
    type</var>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if <var>named type</var> is known to be potentially dangerous (e.g. it
    will be treated by the platform conventions as a native executable, shell script, HTML
    application, or executable-macro-capable document) then optionally alter <var>filename</var> to add a known-safe <span data-x="concept-extension">extension</span>
    (e.g. "<code data-x="">.txt</code>").</p>

    <p class="note">This last step would make it impossible to download executables, which might not
    be desirable. As always, implementors are forced to balance security and usability in this
    matter.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>filename</var> as the file name.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>For the purposes of this algorithm, a file <dfn data-x="concept-extension">extension</dfn>
  consists of any part of the file name that platform conventions dictate will be used for
  identifying the type of the file. For example, many operating systems use the part of the file
  name following the last dot ("<code data-x="">.</code>") in the file name to determine the type of
  the file, and from that the manner in which the file is to be opened or executed.</p>

  <p>User agents should ignore any directory or path information provided by the resource itself,
  its <span>URL</span>, and any <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-download">download</code> attribute, in
  deciding where to store the resulting file in the user's file system.</p>
