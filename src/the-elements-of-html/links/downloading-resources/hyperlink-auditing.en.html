<h5><dfn>Hyperlink auditing</dfn></h5>

  <p>If a <span>hyperlink</span> created by an <code>a</code> or <code>area</code> element has a
  <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute, and the user follows the hyperlink, and
  the value of the element's <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute can be <span
  data-x="parse a url">parsed</span>, relative to the element's <span>node document</span>, without
  failure, then the user agent must take the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code>
  attribute's value, <span data-x="split a string on spaces">split that string on spaces</span>,
  <span data-x="parse a url">parse</span> each resulting token relative to the element's <span>node
  document</span>, and then run these substeps for each <span>resulting URL record</span> <var>ping
  URL</var>, ignoring tokens that fail to parse:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>ping URL</var>'s <span data-x="concept-url-scheme">scheme</span> is not an
   <span>HTTP(S) scheme</span>, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Optionally, abort these steps. (For example, the user agent might wish to ignore any or
   all ping URLs in accordance with the user's expressed preferences.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>request</var> be a new <span data-x="concept-request">request</span> whose
   <span data-x="concept-request-url">url</span> is <var>ping URL</var>, <span
   data-x="concept-request-method">method</span> is `<code data-x="">POST</code>`, <span
   data-x="concept-request-body">body</span> is `<code data-x="">PING</code>`, <span
   data-x="concept-request-client">client</span> is the <span>environment settings object</span> of
   the <code>Document</code> containing the <span>hyperlink</span>, <span
   data-x="concept-request-destination">destination</span> is the empty string,
   <span data-x="concept-request-credentials-mode">credentials mode</span> is "<code
   data-x="">include</code>", <span data-x="concept-request-referrer">referrer</span> is "<code
   data-x="">no-referrer</code>", and whose <span>use-URL-credentials flag</span> is set.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Let <var>target URL</var> be the <span>resulting URL string</span> obtained from <span
    data-x="parse a url">parsing</span> the value of the element's <code
    data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute and then run these substeps:</p>

    <dl class="switch">
     <dt>If the <span data-x="concept-document-url">URL</span> of the <code>Document</code> object
     containing the hyperlink being audited and <var>ping URL</var> have the <span>same
     origin</span></dt>

     <dt>If the origins are different, but the <span data-x="concept-document-https-state">HTTPS
     state</span> of the <code>Document</code> containing the hyperlink being audited is "<code
     data-x="">none</code>"</dt>

     <dd><var>request</var> must include a `<code data-x="http-ping-from">Ping-From</code>` header
     with, as its value, the <span data-x="concept-document-url">URL</span> of the document
     containing the hyperlink, and a `<code data-x="http-ping-to">Ping-To</code>` HTTP header with,
     as its value, the <var>target URL</var>.</dd>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>

     <dd><var>request</var> must include a `<code data-x="http-ping-to">Ping-To</code>` HTTP header
     with, as its value, <var>target URL</var>.  <span class="note"><var>request</var> does not
     include a `<code data-x="http-ping-from">Ping-From</code>` header.</span></dd>
    </dl>
   </li>

   <!--FETCH--><li><p><span data-x="concept-fetch">Fetch</span> <var>request</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>This may be done <span>in parallel</span> with the primary fetch, and is independent of the
  result of that fetch.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow the user to adjust this behavior, for example in conjunction with a
  setting that disables the sending of HTTP `<code data-x="http-referer">Referer</code>` (sic)
  headers. Based on the user's preferences, UAs may either <span>ignore</span> the <code
  data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute altogether, or selectively ignore URLs in the
  list (e.g. ignoring any third-party URLs); this is explicitly accounted for in the steps
  above.</p>

  <p>User agents must ignore any entity bodies returned in the responses. User agents may close the
  connection prematurely once they start receiving a response body.</p>

  <p>When the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute is present, user agents
  should clearly indicate to the user that following the hyperlink will also cause secondary
  requests to be sent in the background, possibly including listing the actual target URLs.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a visual user agent could include the hostnames of the target ping
  URLs along with the hyperlink's actual URL in a status bar or tooltip.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute is redundant with pre-existing
   technologies like HTTP redirects and JavaScript in allowing Web pages to track which off-site
   links are most popular or allowing advertisers to track click-through rates.</p>

   <p>However, the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute provides these advantages
   to the user over those alternatives:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>It allows the user to see the final target URL unobscured.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to inform the user about the out-of-band notifications.</li>

    <li>It allows the user to disable the notifications without losing the underlying link
    functionality.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to optimize the use of available network bandwidth so that the target page
    loads faster.</li>

   </ul>

   <p>Thus, while it is possible to track users without this feature, authors are encouraged to use
   the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute so that the user agent can make the
   user experience more transparent.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- resolving ping urls happens at audit time, so base URL changes affect the values of ping
  attributes -->
