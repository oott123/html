<h4>Interactions of styling and scripting</h4>

  <p>Style sheets, whether added by a <code>link</code> element, a <code>style</code> element, an
  <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> PI, an HTTP `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>` header, or
  some other mechanism, have a <dfn>style sheet ready</dfn> flag, which is initially unset.</p>

  <p>When a style sheet is ready to be applied, its <span>style sheet ready</span> flag must be set.
  If the style sheet referenced no other resources (e.g. it was an internal style sheet given by a
  <code>style</code> element with no <code data-x="">@import</code> rules), then the style rules must
  be <span>immediately</span> made available to script; otherwise, the style rules must only be made available
  to script once the <span>event loop</span> reaches its <i>update the rendering</i> step.</p>

  <p>A style sheet in the context of the <code>Document</code> of an <span>HTML parser</span> or
  <span>XML parser</span> is said to be <dfn>a style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if the
  element was created by that <code>Document</code>'s parser, and the element is either a
  <code>style</code> element or a <code>link</code> element that was an <span
  data-x="rel-stylesheet">external resource link that contributes to the styling processing
  model</span> when the element was created by the parser, and the element's style sheet was enabled
  when the element was created by the parser, and the element's <span>style sheet ready</span> flag
  is not yet set, and, the last time the <span>event loop</span> reached <a href="#step1">step 1</a>,
  the element's <span>root</span> was that <code>Document</code>, and the user agent hasn't given up
  on that particular style sheet yet. A user agent may give up on a style sheet at any time.</p>

  <p class="note">Giving up on a style sheet before the style sheet loads, if the style sheet
  eventually does still load, means that the script might end up operating with incorrect
  information. For example, if a style sheet sets the color of an element to green, but a script
  that inspects the resulting style is executed before the sheet is loaded, the script will find
  that the element is black (or whatever the default color is), and might thus make poor choices
  (e.g. deciding to use black as the color elsewhere on the page, instead of green). Implementors
  have to balance the likelihood of a script using incorrect information with the performance impact
  of doing nothing while waiting for a slow network request to finish.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has a style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if there is
  either <span>a style sheet that is blocking scripts</span> in the context of that
  <code>Document</code>, or if that <code>Document</code> has a <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> that has a <span>parent browsing
  context</span>, and the <span>active document</span> of that <span>parent browsing context</span>
  itself <span>has a style sheet that is blocking scripts</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has no style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if it does not
  <span data-x="has a style sheet that is blocking scripts">have a style sheet that is blocking
  scripts</span> as defined in the previous paragraph.</p>
