  <h5>Other pragma directives</h5>

  <p><dfn data-x="concept-http-equiv-extensions">Extensions to the predefined set of pragma
  directives</dfn> may, under certain conditions, be registered in the <a
  href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/PragmaExtensions">WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page</a>. <ref spec=WHATWGWIKI></p>

  <p>Such extensions must use a name that is identical to an HTTP header registered in the Permanent
  Message Header Field Registry, and must have behavior identical to that described for the HTTP
  header. <ref spec=IANAPERMHEADERS></p>

  <p>Pragma directives corresponding to headers describing metadata, or not requiring specific user
  agent processing, must not be registered; instead, use <span
  data-x="concept-meta-extensions">metadata names</span>. Pragma directives corresponding to headers
  that affect the HTTP processing model (e.g. caching) must not be registered, as they would result
  in HTTP-level behavior being different for user agents that implement HTML than for user agents
  that do not.</p>

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page at any time to add a pragma
  directive satisfying these conditions. Such registrations must specify the following
  information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd><p>The actual name being defined. The name must match a previously-registered HTTP name with
   the same requirements.</p></dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short non-normative description of the purpose of the pragma directive.</p></dd>


   <dt>Specification</dt>

   <dd>A link to the specification defining the corresponding HTTP header.</dd>

  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Conformance checkers must use the information given on the WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page to
  establish if a value is allowed or not: values defined in this specification or listed on the
  aforementioned page must be accepted, whereas values not listed in either this specification or on
  the aforementioned page must be rejected as invalid. Conformance checkers may cache this
  information (e.g. for performance reasons or to avoid the use of unreliable network
  connectivity).</p>
