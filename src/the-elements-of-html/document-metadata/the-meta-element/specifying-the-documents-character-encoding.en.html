<h5 id="charset">Specifying the document's character encoding</h5>

  <!-- READ ME WHEN EDITING: if we ever move this to the "writing HTML" section, then we have to
  duplicate the requirements in the parsing section for conformance checkers, and we have to make
  sure that the requirements for charset="" apply even in XML, for the <meta charset=""> polyglot
  hack. -->

  <p>A <dfn>character encoding declaration</dfn> is a mechanism by which the <span
  data-x="encoding">character encoding</span> used to store or transmit a document is specified.</p>

  <p>The following restrictions apply to <span data-x="character encoding declaration">character
  encoding declarations</span>:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The character encoding name given must be an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
   one of the <span data-x="encoding label">labels</span> of the <span data-x="encoding">character
   encoding</span> used to serialize the file. <ref spec=ENCODING></li>

   <li>The character encoding declaration must be serialized without the use of <span
   data-x="syntax-charref">character references</span> or character escapes of any kind.</li>

   <li id="charset1024"><span data-x="" id="charset512">The element containing the character encoding
   declaration must be serialized completely within the first 1024 bytes of the
   document.</span></li> <!-- span is for historical reasons, to keep an old ID alive -->

  </ul>

  <p>In addition, due to a number of restrictions on <code>meta</code> elements, there can only be
  one <code>meta</code>-based character encoding declaration per document.</p> <!-- conformance
  criteria for this one are given in the XML spec, the <meta> section just after defining
  charset="", and the character encoding pragma section. Note that you _can_ have two character
  encoding declarations per document, if the document is an XML document and one is an XML
  declaration, the other is <meta charset>, and the encoding is UTF-8. -->

  <p>If an <span data-x="HTML documents">HTML document</span> does not start with a BOM, and its
  <span>encoding</span> is not explicitly given by <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type
  metadata</span>, and the document is not <span>an <code>iframe</code> <code
  data-x="attr-iframe-srcdoc">srcdoc</code> document</span>, then the character encoding used must be
  an <span>ASCII-compatible encoding</span>, and the encoding must be specified using a
  <code>meta</code> element with a <code data-x="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attribute or a
  <code>meta</code> element with an <code data-x="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute
  in the <span data-x="attr-meta-http-equiv-content-type">Encoding declaration state</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">A character encoding declaration is required (either in the <span
  data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> or explicitly in the file) even when all
  characters are in the ASCII range, because a character encoding is needed to process non-ASCII
  characters entered by the user in forms, in URLs generated by scripts, and so forth.</p>

  <p>If the document is <span>an <code>iframe</code> <code data-x="attr-iframe-srcdoc">srcdoc</code>
  document</span>, the document must not have a <span>character encoding declaration</span>. (In
  this case, the source is already decoded, since it is part of the document that contained the
  <code>iframe</code>.)</p>

  <p>If an <span data-x="HTML documents">HTML document</span> contains a <code>meta</code> element
  with a <code data-x="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attribute or a <code>meta</code> element
  with an <code data-x="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute in the <span
  data-x="attr-meta-http-equiv-content-type">Encoding declaration state</span>, then the character
  encoding used must be an <span>ASCII-compatible encoding</span>.</p>

  <p>Authors should use <span>UTF-8</span>. Conformance checkers may advise authors against using
  legacy encodings. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Authoring tools should default to using <span>UTF-8</span> for newly-created documents. <ref
  spec=ENCODING></p>

  </div>

  <p>Authors must not use encodings that are not defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard.
  Additionally, authors should not use <span>ISO-2022-JP</span>. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p class="note">Some encodings that are not defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard use bytes in
  the range 0x20 to 0x7E, inclusive, to encode characters other than the corresponding characters in
  the range U+0020 to U+007E, inclusive, and represent a potential security vulnerability: A user
  agent might end up interpreting supposedly benign plain text content as HTML tags and
  JavaScript.</p>

  <p class="note">Using non-UTF-8 encodings can have unexpected results on form submission and URL
  encodings, which use the <span>document's character encoding</span> by default.</p>

  <p>In XML, the XML declaration should be used for inline character encoding information, if
  necessary.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In HTML, to declare that the character encoding is <span>UTF-8</span>, the author could
   include the following markup near the top of the document (in the <code>head</code> element):</p>

   <pre>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"></pre>

   <p>In XML, the XML declaration would be used instead, at the very top of the markup:</p>

   <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?></pre>

  </div>
