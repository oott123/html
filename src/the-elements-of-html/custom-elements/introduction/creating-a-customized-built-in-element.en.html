<h5 id="custom-elements-customized-builtin-example">Creating a customized built-in element</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p><span data-x="customized built-in element">Customized built-in elements</span> are a distinct
  kind of <span>custom element</span>, which are defined slightly differently and used very
  differently compared to <span data-x="autonomous custom element">autonomous custom
  elements</span>. They exist to allow reuse of behaviors from the existing elements of HTML, by
  extending those elements with new custom functionality. This is important since many of the
  existing behaviors of HTML elements can unfortunately not be duplicated by using purely <span
  data-x="autonomous custom element">autonomous custom elements</span>. Instead, <span
  data-x="customized built-in element">customized built-in elements</span> allow the installation of
  custom construction behavior, lifecycle hooks, and prototype chain onto existing elements,
  essentially "mixing in" these capabilities on top of the already-existing element.</p>

  <p><span data-x="customized built-in element">Customized built-in elements</span> require a
  distinct syntax from <span data-x="autonomous custom element">autonomous custom elements</span>
  because user agents and other software key off an element's local name in order to identify the
  element's semantics and behavior. That is, the concept of <span data-x="customized built-in
  element">customized built-in elements</span> building on top of existing behavior depends
  crucially on the extended elements retaining their original local name.</p>

  <p>In this example, we'll be creating a <span>customized built-in element</span> named <code
  data-x="">plastic-button</code>, which behaves like a normal button but gets fancy animation
  effects added whenever you click on it. We start by defining a class, just like before, although
  this time we extend <code>HTMLButtonElement</code> instead of <code>HTMLElement</code>:</p>

  <pre>class PlasticButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.addEventListener("click", () => {
      // Draw some fancy animation effects!
    });
  }
}</pre>

  <p>When defining our custom element, we have to also specify the <code data-x="">extends</code>
  option:</p>

  <pre>customElements.define("plastic-button", PlasticButton, { extends: "button" });</pre>

  <p>In general, the name of the element being extended cannot be determined simply by looking at
  what element interface it extends, as many elements share the same interface (such as
  <code>q</code> and <code>blockquote</code> both sharing <code>HTMLQuoteElement</code>).</p>

  <p>To use our <span>customized built-in element</span>, we use the <code
  data-x="attr-is">is</code> attribute on a <code>button</code> element:</p>

  <pre>&lt;button is="plastic-button">Click Me!&lt;/button></pre>

  <p>Trying to use a <span>customized built-in element</span> as an <span>autonomous custom
  element</span> will <em>not</em> work; that is, <code data-x="">&lt;plastic-button>Click
  me?&lt;/plastic-button></code> will simply create an <code>HTMLElement</code> with no special
  behavior.</p>

  <p>If you need to create a type-extended element programmatically, you can use the following form
  of <code data-x="dom-Document-createElement">createElement()</code>:</p>

  <pre>const plasticButton = document.createElement("button", { is: "plastic-button" });
plasticButton.textContent = "Click me!";</pre>

  <p>And as before, the constructor will also work:</p>

  <pre>const plasticButton2 = new PlasticButton();
console.log(plasticButton2.localName);          // will output "button"
console.log(plasticButton2.getAttribute("is")); // will output "plastic-button"</pre>

  <p>Notably, all the of the ways in which <code>button</code> is special apply to such "plastic
  buttons" as well: their focus behavior, ability to participate in <span
  data-x="concept-form-submit">form submission</span>, the <code
  data-x="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, and so on.</p>

  <p id="customized-built-in-element-restrictions"><span data-x="customized built-in
  element">Customized built-in elements</span> are designed to allow extension of existing HTML
  elements that have useful user-agent supplied behavior or APIs. As such, they can only extend
  existing HTML elements defined in this specification, and cannot extend legacy elements such as
  <code>bgsound</code>, <code>blink</code>, <code>isindex</code>, <code>multicol</code>,
  <code>nextid</code>, or <code>spacer</code> that have been defined to use
  <code>HTMLUnknownElement</code> as their <span>element interface</span>.</p>

  <p>One reason for this requirement is future-compatibility: if a <span>customized built-in
  element</span> was defined that extended a currently-unknown element, for example <code
  data-x="">combobox</code>, this would prevent this specification from defining a <code
  data-x="">combobox</code> element in the future, as consumers of the derived <span>customized
  built-in element</span> would have come to depend on their base element having no interesting
  user-agent-supplied behavior.</p>

  <p>Additionally, <code>applet</code> and <code>keygen</code> elements cannot be extended, as they
  are in the process of being removed from the Web platform.</p>
