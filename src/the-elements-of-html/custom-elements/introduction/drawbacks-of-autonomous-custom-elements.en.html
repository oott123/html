  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>As specified below, and alluded to above, simply defining and using an element called
  <code data-x="">taco-button</code> does not mean that such elements <span
  data-x="represents">represent</span> buttons. That is, tools such as Web browsers, search engines,
  or accessibility technology will not automatically treat the resulting element as a button just
  based on its defined name.</p>

  <p>To convey the desired button semantics to a variety of users, while still using an
  <span>autonomous custom element</span>, a number of techniques would need to be employed:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>The addition of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute would make the
   <code data-x="">taco-button</code> <span>interactive content</span>, thus making it
   <span data-x="focusable area">focusable</span>. Note that if the
   <code data-x="">taco-button</code> were to become logically disabled, the <code
   data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute would need to be removed.</p></li>

   <li><p>The addition of various ARIA attributes helps convey semantics to accessibility
   technology. For example, setting the <code data-x="attr-aria-role">role</code> attribute to
   "<code data-x="attr-aria-role-button">button</code>" will convey the semantics that this is a
   button, enabling users to successfully interact with the control using usual button-like
   interactions in their accessibility technology. Setting the <code
   data-x="attr-aria-label">aria-label</code> attribute is necessary to give the button an
   <span data-x="concept-accessible-name">accessible name</span>, instead of having accessibility
   technology traverse its child text nodes and announce them. And setting <code
   data-x="attr-aria-disabled">aria-disabled</code> to "<code data-x="">true</code>" when the button
   is logically disabled conveys to accessibility technology the button's disabled state.</p></li>

   <li><p>The addition of event handlers to handle commonly-expected button behaviors helps convey
   the semantics of the button to Web browser users. In this case, the most relevant event handler
   would be one that proxies appropriate <code data-x="event-keydown">keydown</code> events to
   become <code data-x="event-click">click</code> events, so that you can activate the button both
   with keyboard and by clicking.</li>

   <li><p>In addition to any default visual styling provided for <code data-x="">taco-button</code>
   elements, the visual styling will also need to be updated to reflect changes in logical state,
   such as becoming disabled; that is, whatever stylesheet has rules for <code
   data-x="">taco-button</code> will also need to have rules for <code
   data-x="">taco-button[disabled]</code>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>With these points in mind, a full-featured <code data-x="">taco-button</code> that took on the
  responsibility of conveying button semantics (including the ability to be disabled) might look
  something like this:</p>

  <pre>class TacoButton extends HTMLElement {
  static get observedAttributes() { return ["disabled"]; }

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.addEventListener("keydown", e => {
      if (e.keyCode === 32 || e.keyCode === 13) {
        this.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", {
          bubbles: true,
          cancelable: true
        }));
      }
    });

    this.addEventListener("click", e => {
      if (this.disabled) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation();
      }
    });

    this._observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
      this.setAttribute("aria-label", this.textContent);
    });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.setAttribute("role", "button");
    this.setAttribute("tabindex", "0");

    this._observer.observe(this, {
      childList: true,
      characterData: true,
      subtree: true
    });
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    this._observer.disconnect();
  }

  get disabled() {
    return this.hasAttribute("disabled");
  }

  set disabled(v) {
    if (v) {
      this.setAttribute("disabled", "");
    } else {
      this.removeAttribute("disabled");
    }
  }

  attributeChangedCallback() {
    // only is called for the disabled attribute due to observedAttributes
    if (this.disabled) {
      this.removeAttribute("tabindex");
      this.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "true");
    } else {
      this.setAttribute("tabindex", "0");
      this.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "false");
    }
  }
}</pre>

  <p>Even with this rather-complicated element definition, the element is not a pleasure to use for
  consumers: it will be continually "sprouting" <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> and
  <code data-x="attr-aria-*">aria-*</code> attributes of its own volition. This is because as of now
  there is no way to specify default accessibility semantics or focus behavior for custom elements,
  forcing the use of these attributes to do so (even though they are usually reserved for allowing
  the consumer to override default behavior).</p>

  <p>In contrast, a simple <span>customized built-in element</span>, as shown in the previous
  section, would automatically inherit the semantics and behavior of the <code>button</code>
  element, with no need to implement these behaviors manually. In general, for any elements with
  nontrivial behavior and semantics that build on top of existing elements of HTML, <span
  data-x="customized built-in element">customized built-in elements</span> will be easier to
  develop, maintain, and consume.</p>
