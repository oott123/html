  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p><span data-x="custom element">Custom elements</span> provide a way for authors to build their
  own fully-featured DOM elements. Although authors could always use non-standard elements in their
  documents, with application-specific behavior added after the fact by scripting or similar, such
  elements have historically been non-conforming and not very functional. By <span
  data-x="element definition">defining</span> a custom element, authors can inform the parser how to
  properly construct an element and how elements of that class should react to changes.</p>

  <p>Custom elements are part of a larger effort to "rationalise the platform", by explaining
  existing platform features (like the elements of HTML) in terms of lower-level author-exposed
  extensibility points (like custom element definition). Although today there are many limitations
  on the capabilities of custom elements—both functionally and semantically—that prevent them from
  fully explaining the behaviors of HTML's existing elements, we hope to shrink this gap over
  time.</p>
