  <h5 id="custom-elements-upgrades-examples">Upgrading elements after their creation</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Because <span>element definition</span> can occur at any time, a non-custom element could be
  <span data-x="create an element">created</span>, and then later become a <span>custom
  element</span> after an appropriate <span data-x="custom element definition">definition</span> is
  registered. We call this process "upgrading" the element, from a normal element into a custom
  element.</p>

  <p><span data-x="custom-element-upgrades">Upgrades</span> enable scenarios where it may be
  preferable for <span data-x="custom element definition">custom element definitions</span> to be
  registered after relevant elements has been initially created, such as by the parser. They allow
  progressive enhancement of the content in the custom element. For example, in the following HTML
  document the element definition for <code data-x="">img-viewer</code> is loaded
  asynchronously:</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
&lt;title>Image viewer example&lt;/title>

&lt;img-viewer filter="Kelvin">
  &lt;img src="images/tree.jpg" alt="A beautiful tree towering over an empty savannah">
&lt;/img-viewer>

&lt;script src="js/elements/img-viewer.js" async>&lt;/script></pre>

  <p>The definition for the <code data-x="">img-viewer</code> element here is loaded using a
  <code>script</code> element marked with the <code data-x="attr-script-async">async</code>
  attribute, placed after the <code data-x="">&lt;img-viewer></code> tag in the markup. While the
  script is loading, the <code data-x="">img-viewer</code> element will be treated as an undefined
  element, similar to a <code>span</code>. Once the script loads, it will define the <code
  data-x="">img-viewer</code> element, and the existing <code data-x="">img-viewer</code> element on
  the page will be upgraded, applying the custom element's definition (which presumably includes
  applying an image filter identified by the string "Kelvin", enhancing the image's visual
  appearance).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Note that <span data-x="custom-element-upgrades">upgrades</span> only apply to elements in the
  document tree. (Formally, elements that are <span>connected</span>.) An element that is not
  inserted into a document will stay un-upgraded. An example illustrates this point:</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
&lt;title>Upgrade edge-cases example&lt;/title>

&lt;example-element>&lt;/example-element>

&lt;script>
  "use strict";

  const inDocument = document.querySelector("example-element");
  const outOfDocument = document.createElement("example-element");

  // Before the element definition, both are HTMLElement:
  console.assert(inDocument instanceof HTMLElement);
  console.assert(outOfDocument instanceof HTMLElement);

  class ExampleElement extends HTMLElement {}
  customElements.define("example-element", ExampleElement);

  // After element definition, the in-document element was upgraded:
  console.assert(inDocument instanceof ExampleElement);
  console.assert(!(outOfDocument instanceof ExampleElement));

  document.body.appendChild(outOfDocument);

  // Now that we've moved the element into the document, it too was upgraded:
  console.assert(outOfDocument instanceof ExampleElement);
&lt;/script></pre>
