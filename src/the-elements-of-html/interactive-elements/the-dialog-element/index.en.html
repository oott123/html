  <p>The <code>dialog</code> element represents a part of an application that a user interacts with
  to perform a task, for example a dialog box, inspector, or window.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-dialog-open">open</code></dfn> attribute is a <span>boolean
  attribute</span>. When specified, it indicates that the <code>dialog</code> element is active and
  that the user can interact with it.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>A <code>dialog</code> element without an <code data-x="attr-dialog-open">open</code> attribute
  specified should not be shown to the user. This requirement may be implemented indirectly through
  the style layer. For example, user agents that <a href="#renderingUA">support the suggested
  default rendering</a> implement this requirement using the CSS rules described in the <a
  href="#rendering">rendering section</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute must not be specified on
  <code>dialog</code> elements.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>All <code>dialog</code> elements are always in one of three modes: <dfn>normal alignment</dfn>,
  <dfn>centered alignment</dfn>, and <dfn>magic alignment</dfn>. When a <code>dialog</code> element
  is created, it must be placed in the <span>normal alignment</span> mode. In this mode, normal CSS
  requirements apply to the element. The <span>centered alignment</span> mode is only used for
  <code>dialog</code> elements that are in the <span>top layer</span>. <ref spec=FULLSCREEN> <ref spec=CSS></p>

  <p>When an element <var>subject</var> is placed in <span>centered alignment</span> mode,
  and when it is in that mode and has new rendering boxes created, the user agent must set up the
  element such that its top static position, for the purposes of calculating the
  <span>used value</span> of the <span>'top'</span> property, is the value that would place the
  element's top <span>margin edge</span> as far from the top of the <span>viewport</span> as the
  element's bottom <span>margin edge</span> from the bottom of the <span>viewport</span>, if the
  element's height is less than the height of the <span>viewport</span>, and otherwise is the value
  that would place the element's top <span>margin edge</span> at the top of the
  <span>viewport</span>.</p>

  <p>If there is a <code>dialog</code> element with <span>centered alignment</span> and that is
  <span>being rendered</span> when its <span>browsing context</span> changes <span>viewport</span>
  width (as measured in <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>), then the user agent must recreate
  the element's boxes, recalculating its top static position as in the previous paragraph.</p>

  <p>This top static position of a <code>dialog</code> element with <span>centered alignment</span>
  must remain the element's top static position until its boxes are recreated. (The element's static
  position is only used in calculating the <span>used value</span> of the <span>'top'</span>
  property in certain situations; it's not used, for instance, to position the element if its
  <span>'position'</span> property is set to 'static'.)</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>set up the position</dfn> of an element <var>subject</var> using an anchor <var>anchor</var>, it must run the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>anchor</var> is a <code>MouseEvent</code> object, then run these
    substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If <var>anchor</var>'s target element does not have a rendered box, or is in a
     different document than <var>subject</var>, then let <var>subject</var> be
     in the <span>centered alignment</span> mode, and abort the <span>set up the position</span>
     steps.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>anchor element</var> be an anonymous element rendered as a box with
     zero height and width (so its <span>margin box</span> and <span>border box</span> both just
     form a point), positioned so that its top and left are at the coordinate identified by the
     event, and whose properties all compute to their initial values.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>Otherwise, let <var>anchor element</var> be <var>anchor</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Put <var>subject</var> in the <span>magic alignment</span> mode, aligned to <var>anchor element</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>While an element <var>A</var> has <span>magic alignment</span>, aligned to an element
  <var>B</var>, the following requirements apply:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>

    <p>If at any time either <var>A</var> or <var>B</var> cease having rendered
    boxes, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> cease being in the same
    <code>Document</code>, or <var>B</var> ceases being earlier than <var>A</var> in <span>tree order</span>, then, if <var>subject</var> is in the
    <span>pending dialog stack</span>, let <var>subject</var>'s mode become <span>centered
    alignment</span>, otherwise, let <var>subject</var>'s mode become <span>normal
    alignment</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><var>A</var>'s <span>'position'</span> property must compute to the keyword '<span
    data-x="css-position-absolute-anchored">absolute-anchored</span>' rather than whatever it would
    otherwise compute to (i.e. the <span>'position'</span> property's <span>specified value</span>
    is ignored).</p>

    <p class="note">The '<span data-x="css-position-absolute-anchored">absolute-anchored</span>'
    keyword's requirements are described below.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The anchor points for <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are defined as per the
    appropriate entry in the following list:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

    <p class="note">The rules above generally use <var>A</var>'s <em>margin</em> box, but
    <var>B</var>'s <em>border</em> box. This is because while <var>A</var> always
    has a <span>margin box</span>, and using the <span>margin box</span> allows for the dialog to be
    positioned offset from the box it is annotating, <var>B</var> sometimes does not have a
    <span>margin box</span> (e.g. if it is a <span>'table-cell'</span>), or has a <span>margin
    box</span> whose position may be not entirely clear (e.g. in the face of <span
    data-x="collapsing margins">margin collapsing</span> and <span>'clear'</span> handling of
    <span>in-flow</span> blocks).</p>

    <p>In cases where <var>B</var> does not have a <span>border box</span> but its
    <span>border box</span> is used by the algorithm above, user agents must use its first box's
    <span>content area</span> instead. (This is in particular an issue with boxes in tables that
    have <span>'border-collapse'</span> set to 'collapse'.)</p>

    is <span data-x="magic alignment">magically aligned</span>. Elements aligned in this way are
    <i>absolutely positioned</i>. For the purposes of determining the <span>containing block</span>
    of other elements, the '<span data-x="css-position-absolute-anchored">absolute-anchored</span>'
    keyword must be treated like the 'absolute' keyword.</p>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p class="note">The trivial example of an element that does not have a rendered box is one whose
  <span>'display'</span> property computes to 'none'. However, there are many other cases; e.g.
  table columns do not have boxes (their properties merely affect other boxes).</p>

  <p class="note">If an element to which another element is anchored changes rendering, the anchored
  element will be repositioned accordingly. (In other words, the requirements above are live,
  they are not just calculated once per anchored element.)</p>

  <p class="note">The '<span data-x="css-position-absolute-anchored">absolute-anchored</span>'
  keyword is not a keyword that can be specified in CSS; the <span>'position'</span> property can
  only compute to this value if the <code>dialog</code> element is positioned via the APIs described
  above.</p>

  <p>User agents in visual interactive media should allow the user to pan the <span>viewport</span>
  to access all parts of a <code>dialog</code> element's <span>border box</span>, even if the
  element is larger than the <span>viewport</span> and the <span>viewport</span> would otherwise not
  have a scroll mechanism (e.g. because the <span>viewport</span>'s <span>'overflow'</span> property
  is set to 'hidden').</p>
