  <h5 id="context-menu-processing-model"><span id="processing-model-4"></span>Processing model</h5>

  <p>Each element has an <dfn>assigned context menu</dfn>, which can be null. If an element <var>A</var> has a <code data-x="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> attribute, and there is
  an element with the ID given by <var>A</var>'s <code
  data-x="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> attribute's value in <var>A</var>'s
  <span>tree</span>, and the first such element in <span>tree order</span> is a <code>menu</code>
  element whose <code data-x="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span data-x="popup
  menu state">popup menu</span> state, then <var>A</var>'s <span>assigned context menu</span> is
  that element. Otherwise, if <var>A</var> has a parent element, then <var>A</var>'s <span>assigned
  context menu</span> is the <span>assigned context menu</span> of its parent element. Otherwise,
  <var>A</var>'s <span>assigned context menu</span> is null.</p>

  <p>When an element's context menu is requested (e.g. by the user right-clicking the element, or
  pressing a context menu key), the user agent must apply the appropriate rules from the following
  list:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the user requested a context menu using a pointing device</dt>

   <dd><p>The user agent must <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> at the element for which the menu was requested,
   using <code>MouseEvent</code>, with the <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> and <code
   data-x="dom-Event-cancelable">cancelable</code> attributes initialized to true, and other
   attributes initialized to the same values as the last <code>MouseEvent</code> user interaction
   event that was fired as part of the gesture that was interpreted as a request for the context
   menu.</p></dd>

   <dt>Otherwise</dt>

   <dd><p>The user agent must <span data-x="fire a synthetic mouse event">fire a synthetic mouse
   event named <code data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code></span> at the element for which
   the menu was requested.</p></dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">Typically, therefore, the firing of the <code
  data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event will be the default action of a <code
  data-x="event-mouseup">mouseup</code> or <code data-x="event-keyup">keyup</code> event. The exact
  sequence of events is UA-dependent, as it will vary based on platform conventions.</p>

  <p>The default action of the <code data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event depends on
  whether or not the element for which the menu was requested has a non-null <span>assigned context
  menu</span> when the event dispatch has completed, as follows.</p>

  <p>If the <span>assigned context menu</span> of the element for which the menu was requested is
  null, the default action must be for the user agent to show its default context menu, if it has
  one.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, let <var>subject</var> be the element for which the menu was requested, and let
  <var>menu</var> be the <span>assigned context menu</span> of <var>target</var> immediately after
  the <code data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event's dispatch has completed. The user
  agent must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>build</var> be the result of <span data-x="concept-event-fire">firing an
   event</span> named <code data-x="event-show">show</code> at <var>menu</var>, using
   <code>RelatedEvent</code>, with the <code data-x="dom-Event-cancelable">cancelable</code>
   attribute initialized to true and the <code
   data-x="dom-RelatedEvent-relatedTarget">relatedTarget</code> attribute initialized to
   <var>subject</var>.</p>
   <!-- v2: include modifier key information -->

   <li><p>If <var>build</var> is true, then <span data-x="build and show a menu">build and
   show</span> the menu for <var>menu</var> with <var>subject</var> as the subject.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The user agent may also provide access to its default context menu, if any, with the context
  menu shown. For example, it could merge the menu items from the two menus together, or provide the
  page's context menu as a submenu of the default menu. In general, user agents are encouraged to
  de-emphasize their own contextual menu items, so as to give the author's context menu the
  appearance of legitimacy &mdash; to allow documents to feel like "applications" rather than "mere
  Web pages".</p>

  <p>User agents may provide means for bypassing the context menu processing model, ensuring that
  the user can always access the UA's default context menus. For example, the user agent could
  handle right-clicks that have the Shift key depressed in such a way that it does not fire the
  <code data-x="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event and instead always shows the default
  context menu.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-contextMenu">contextMenu</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code data-x="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> content attribute.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, an image of cats is given a context menu with four possible commands:</p>

   <pre>&lt;img src="cats.jpeg" alt="Cats" contextmenu=catsmenu>
&lt;menu type="context" id="catsmenu">
 &lt;menuitem label="Pet the kittens" onclick="kittens.pet()">
 &lt;menuitem label="Cuddle with the kittens" onclick="kittens.cuddle()">
 &lt;menu label="Feed the kittens"><!-- note: contents of this submenu aren't visible in the pictures below -->
  &lt;menuitem label="Fish" onclick="kittens.feed(fish)">
  &lt;menuitem label="Chicken" onclick="kittens.feed(chicken)">
 &lt;/menu>
&lt;/menu></pre>

   <p>When a user of a mouse-operated visual Web browser right-clicks on the image, the browser
   might pop up a context menu like this:</p>

   <p><img src="/images/contextmenu-collapsed.png" alt="A context menu, shown over a picture of cats, with four lines: the first two offering the menu items described in the markup above ('Pet the kittens' and 'Cuddle with the kittens'), the third giving a submenu labeled 'Feed the kittens', and the fourth, after a horizontal splitter, consisting of only a downwards-pointing disclosure triangle.">

   <p>When the user clicks the disclosure triangle, such a user agent would expand the context menu
   in place, to show the browser's own commands:</p>

   <p><img src="/images/contextmenu-expanded.png" alt="This would result in the same basic interface, but with a longer menu; the disclosure triangle having been replaced by items such as 'View Image', 'Copy Image', 'Copy Image Location', and so forth.">

  </div>
