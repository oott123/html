<h4>Case-sensitivity of the CSS <span>'attr()'</span> function</h4>

  <p>The CSS Values and Units specification leaves the case-sensitivity of attribute names for the
  purpose of the <span>'attr()'</span> function to be defined by the host language. <ref
  spec=CSSVALUES></p>

  <p>When comparing the attribute name part of a CSS <span>'attr()'</span> function to the names of
  namespace-less attributes on <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>HTML documents</span>, the name
  part of the CSS <span>'attr()'</span> function must first be <span>converted to ASCII
  lowercase</span>. The same function when compared to other attributes must be compared according
  to its original case. In both cases, the comparison is <span>case-sensitive</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">This is the same as comparing the name part of a CSS <span>attribute
  selector</span>, specified in the next section.</p>
