<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>

  <p>HTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for marking up footnotes. Here are the suggested
  alternatives.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>For short inline annotations, the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute could <!--
  SHOULD, modulo title-warning --> be used.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, two parts of a dialogue are annotated with footnote-like content using the
   <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p> &lt;b>Customer&lt;/b>: Hello! I wish to register a complaint. Hello. Miss?
&lt;p> &lt;b>Shopkeeper&lt;/b>: <strong>&lt;span title="Colloquial pronunciation of 'What do you'"</strong>
>Watcha&lt;/span> mean, miss?
&lt;p> &lt;b>Customer&lt;/b>: Uh, I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint.
&lt;p> &lt;b>Shopkeeper&lt;/b>: Sorry, &lt;span <strong>title="This is, of course, a lie."</strong>>we're
closing for lunch&lt;/span>.</pre>

  </div>

  <!-- search for title-warning if modifying this paragraph -->
  <p class="note">Unfortunately, relying on the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute is
  currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as
  required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a
  tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a
  modern phone or tablet).</p>

  <p class="note">If the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute is used, CSS can be used to
  draw the reader's attention to the elements with the attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, the following CSS places a dashed line below elements that have a <code
   data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute.</p>

   <pre>[title] { border-bottom: thin dashed; }</pre>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>For longer annotations, the <code>a</code> element should be used, pointing to an element later
  in the document. The convention is that the contents of the link be a number in square
  brackets.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a footnote in the dialogue links to a paragraph below the dialogue. The
   paragraph then reciprocally links back to the dialogue, allowing the user to return to the
   location of the footnote.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p> Announcer: Number 16: The &lt;i>hand&lt;/i>.
&lt;p> Interviewer: Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight
Mr Norman St John Polevaulter, who for the past few years has been
contradicting people. Mr Polevaulter, why &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you
contradict people?
&lt;p> Norman: I don't. &lt;sup>&lt;a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
&lt;p> Interviewer: You told me you did!
<em>...</em>
&lt;section>
 &lt;p id="fn1">&lt;a href="#r1">[1]&lt;/a> This is, naturally, a lie,
 but paradoxically if it were true he could not say so without
 contradicting the interviewer and thus making it false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>For side notes, longer annotations that apply to entire sections of the text rather than just
  specific words or sentences, the <code>aside</code> element should be used.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a sidebar is given after a dialogue, giving it some context.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p> &lt;span class="speaker">Customer&lt;/span>: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
&lt;p> &lt;span class="speaker">Shopkeeper&lt;/span>: I'm sorry?
&lt;p> &lt;span class="speaker">Customer&lt;/span>: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
&lt;p> &lt;span class="speaker">Shopkeeper&lt;/span>: No no no, this's'a tobacconist's.
&lt;aside>
 &lt;p>In 1970, the British Empire lay in ruins, and foreign
 nationalists frequented the streets &mdash; many of them Hungarians
 (not the streets &mdash; the foreign nationals). Sadly, Alexander
 Yalt has been publishing incompetently-written phrase books.
&lt;/aside></pre>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>For figures or tables, footnotes can be included in the relevant <code>figcaption</code> or
  <code>caption</code> element, or in surrounding prose.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a <!-- round --> table has cells with footnotes that are given in prose. A
   <code>figure</code> element is used to give a single legend to the combination of the table and
   its footnotes.</p>

   <pre>&lt;figure>
 &lt;figcaption>Table 1. Alternative activities for knights.&lt;/figcaption>
 &lt;table>
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;th> Activity
   &lt;th> Location
   &lt;th> Cost
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> Dance
   &lt;td> Wherever possible
   &lt;td> &#x00A3;0&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#fn1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> Routines, chorus scenes&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#fn2">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
   &lt;td> Undisclosed
   &lt;td> Undisclosed
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> Dining&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#fn3">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
   &lt;td> Camelot
   &lt;td> Cost of ham, jam, and spam&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#fn4">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
 &lt;/table>
 &lt;p id="fn1">1. Assumed.&lt;/p>
 &lt;p id="fn2">2. Footwork impeccable.&lt;/p>
 &lt;p id="fn3">3. Quality described as "well".&lt;/p>
 &lt;p id="fn4">4. A lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figure></pre>

  </div>
