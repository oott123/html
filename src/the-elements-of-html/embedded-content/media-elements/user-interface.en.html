  <h5>User interface</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-media-controls">controls</code></dfn> attribute is a <span>boolean
  attribute</span>. If present, it indicates that the author has not provided a scripted controller
  and would like the user agent to provide its own set of controls.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>If the attribute is present, or if <span data-x="concept-n-noscript">scripting is
  disabled</span> for the <span>media element</span>, then the user agent should <dfn>expose a user
  interface to the user</dfn>. This user interface should include features to begin playback, pause
  playback, seek to an arbitrary position in the content (if the content supports arbitrary
  seeking), change the volume, change the display of closed captions or embedded sign-language
  tracks, select different audio tracks or turn on audio descriptions, and show the media content in
  manners more suitable to the user (e.g. fullscreen video or in an independent resizable window).
  Other controls may also be made available.</p>

  <p>Even when the attribute is absent, however, user agents may provide controls to affect playback
  of the media resource (e.g. play, pause, seeking, track selection, and volume controls), but such
  features should not interfere with the page's normal rendering. For example, such features could
  be exposed in the <span>media element</span>'s context menu, platform media keys, or a remote
  control. The user agent may implement this simply by <span data-x="expose a user interface to the
  user">exposing a user interface to the user</span> as described above (as if the <code
  data-x="attr-media-controls">controls</code> attribute was present).</p>

  <p>If the user agent <span data-x="expose a user interface to the user">exposes a user interface to
  the user</span> by displaying controls over the <span>media element</span>, then the user agent
  should suppress any user interaction events while the user agent is interacting with this
  interface. (For example, if the user clicks on a video's playback control, <code
  data-x="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> events and so forth would not simultaneously be fired at
  elements on the page.)</p>

  <p>Where possible (specifically, for starting, stopping, pausing, and unpausing playback, for
  seeking, for changing the rate of playback, for fast-forwarding or rewinding, for listing,
  enabling, and disabling text tracks, and for muting or changing the volume of the audio), user
  interface features exposed by the user agent must be implemented in terms of the DOM API described
  above, so that, e.g., all the same events fire.</p>

  <p>Features such as fast-forward or rewind must be implemented by only changing the <code
  data-x="">playbackRate</code> attribute (and not the <code data-x="">defaultPlaybackRate</code>
  attribute).</p>

  <p>Seeking must be implemented in terms of <span data-x="dom-media-seek">seeking</span> to the
  requested position in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>media timeline</span>. For media
  resources where seeking to an arbitrary position would be slow, user agents are encouraged to use
  the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag when seeking in response to the user manipulating an
  approximate position interface such as a seek bar.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of listing chapters in the <span>media resource</span>, only <span data-x="text
  track">text tracks</span> in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span>
  that are <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span> and whose <span>text track kind</span> is
  <code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-chapters">chapters</code> should be used. Such tracks must be
  interpreted according to the <span>rules for constructing the chapter tree from a text
  track</span>. When seeking in response to a user manipulating a chapter selection interface, user
  agents should not use the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-controls">controls</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the same name.</p>

    attribute, and false if the <code data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code> attribute is being

    <p>Can be set, to change whether the audio is muted or not.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> has a <dfn data-x="concept-media-volume">playback volume</dfn>, which is a fraction in the range 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (loudest).
  Initially, the volume should be 1.0, but user agents may remember the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise, so the volume may start at other values.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback volume</span> of any audio portions of the
  <span>media element</span>. On setting, if the new value is in the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, the
  <span>media element</span>'s <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback volume</span> must be
  set to the new value. If the new value is outside the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, then, on
  setting, an <span>"<code>IndexSizeError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code> must be thrown
  instead.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> can also be <dfn data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</dfn>. If
  anything is muting the element, then it is muted. (For example, when the <span>direction of
  playback</span> is backwards, the element is muted.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the value
  to which it was last set. When a <span>media element</span> is created, if the element has a <code
  data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code> content attribute specified, then the <code
  data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> IDL attribute should be set to true; otherwise, the user
  agents may set the value to the user's preferred value (e.g. remembering the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise). While the <code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code>
  IDL attribute is set to true, the <span>media element</span> must be <span
  data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>.</p>

  <p>Whenever either of the values that would be returned by the <code
  data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code> and <code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> IDL
  attributes change, the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span
  data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-media-volumechange">volumechange</code> at the <span>media element</span>. Then, if
  the <span>media element</span> is not <span>allowed to play</span>, the user agent must run the
  <span>internal pause steps</span> for the <span>media element</span>.</p>

  <p>An element's <dfn>effective media volume</dfn> is determined as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the user has indicated that the user agent is to override the volume of the element,
   then the element's <span>effective media volume</span> is the volume desired by the user. Abort
   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's audio output is <span data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>, the
   element's <span>effective media volume</span> is zero. Abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>volume</var> be the <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback
   volume</span> of the audio portions of the <span>media element</span>, in range 0.0 (silent) to
   1.0 (loudest).</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's <span>effective media volume</span> is <var>volume</var>,
   interpreted relative to the range 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being silent, and 1.0 being the loudest
   setting, values in between increasing in loudness. The range need not be linear. The loudest
   setting may be lower than the system's loudest possible setting; for example the user could have
   set a maximum volume.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code></dfn> content attribute on <span
  data-x="media element">media elements</span> is a <span>boolean attribute</span> that controls the
  default state of the audio output of the <span>media resource</span>, potentially overriding user
  preferences.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-defaultMuted">defaultMuted</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code> content attribute.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">This attribute has no dynamic effect (it only controls the default state of the
  element).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This video (an advertisement) autoplays, but to avoid annoying users, it does so without
   sound, and allows the user to turn the sound on. The user agent can pause the video if it's
   unmuted without a user interaction.</p>

   <pre>&lt;video src="adverts.cgi?kind=video" controls autoplay loop muted>&lt;/video></pre>
