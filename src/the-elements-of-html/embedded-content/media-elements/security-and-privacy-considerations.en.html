  <h5>Security and privacy considerations</h5>

  <p>The main security and privacy implications of the <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>
  elements come from the ability to embed media cross-origin. There are two directions that threats
  can flow: from hostile content to a victim page, and from a hostile page to victim content.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>If a victim page embeds hostile content, the threat is that the content might contain scripted
  code that attempts to interact with the <code>Document</code> that embeds the content. To avoid
  this, user agents must ensure that there is no access from the content to the embedding page. In
  the case of media content that uses DOM concepts, the embedded content must be treated as if it
  was in its own unrelated <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, if an SVG animation was embedded in a <code>video</code> element,
  the user agent would not give it access to the DOM of the outer page. From the perspective of
  scripts in the SVG resource, the SVG file would appear to be in a lone top-level browsing context
  with no parent.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>If a hostile page embeds victim content, the threat is that the embedding page could obtain
  information from the content that it would not otherwise have access to. The API does expose some
  information: the existence of the media, its type, its duration, its size, and the performance
  characteristics of its host. Such information is already potentially problematic, but in practice
  the same information can more or less be obtained using the <code>img</code> element, and so it
  has been deemed acceptable.</p>

  <p>However, significantly more sensitive information could be obtained if the user agent further
  exposes metadata within the content such as subtitles or chapter titles. Such information is
  therefore only exposed if the video resource uses CORS. The <code
  data-x="attr-media-crossorigin">crossorigin</code> attribute allows authors to enable CORS. <ref
  spec=FETCH></p>

  <p class="example">Without this restriction, an attacker could trick a user running within a
  corporate network into visiting a site that attempts to load a video from a previously leaked
  location on the corporation's intranet. If such a video included confidential plans for a new
  product, then being able to read the subtitles would present a serious confidentiality breach.</p>
