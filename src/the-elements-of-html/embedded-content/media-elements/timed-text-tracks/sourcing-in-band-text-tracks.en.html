  <h6>Sourcing in-band text tracks</h6>

  <p>A <dfn>media-resource-specific text track</dfn> is a <span>text track</span> that corresponds
  to data found in the <span>media resource</span>.</p>


  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Rules for processing and rendering such data are defined by the relevant specifications, e.g.
  the specification of the video format if the <span>media resource</span> is a video. Details for
  some legacy formats can be found in the <cite>Sourcing In-band Media Resource Tracks from Media
  Containers into HTML</cite> specification. <ref spec=INBAND></p>

  <p>When a <span>media resource</span> contains data that the user agent recognizes and supports as
  being equivalent to a <span>text track</span>, the user agent <a
  href="#found-a-media-resource-specific-timed-track">runs</a> the <dfn>steps to expose a
  media-resource-specific text track</dfn> with the relevant data, as follows.</p>

  <!-- this runs synchronously from a fetch task -->

  <ol>

   <li><p>Associate the relevant data with a new <span>text track</span> and its corresponding new
   <code>TextTrack</code> object. The <span>text track</span> is a <span>media-resource-specific
   text track</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the new <span>text track</span>'s <span data-x="text track kind">kind</span>, <span
   data-x="text track label">label</span>, and <span data-x="text track language">language</span>
   based on the semantics of the relevant data, as defined by the relevant specification. If there
   is no label in that data, then the <span data-x="text track label">label</span> must be set to the
   empty string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Associate the <span>text track list of cues</span> with the <span>rules for updating the
   text track rendering</span> appropriate for the format in question.</p>

   <li>

    <p>If the new <span>text track</span>'s <span data-x="text track kind">kind</span> is <code
    data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-metadata">metadata</code>, then set the <span>text track in-band
    metadata track dispatch type</span> as follows, based on the type of the <span>media
    resource</span>:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If the <span>media resource</span> is an Ogg file</dt>

     <dd>The <span>text track in-band metadata track dispatch type</span> must be set to the value
     of the Name header field. <ref spec=OGGSKELETONHEADERS></dd>

     <dt>If the <span>media resource</span> is a WebM file</dt>

     <dd>The <span>text track in-band metadata track dispatch type</span> must be set to the value
     of the <code data-x="">CodecID</code> element. <ref spec=WEBMCG></dd>

     <dt>If the <span>media resource</span> is an MPEG-2 file</dt>

     <dd>Let <var>stream type</var> be the value of the "stream_type" field describing the
     text track's type in the file's program map section, interpreted as an 8-bit unsigned integer.
     Let <var>length</var> be the value of the "ES_info_length" field for the track in the
     same part of the program map section, interpreted as an integer as defined by the MPEG-2
     specification. Let <var>descriptor bytes</var> be the <var>length</var> bytes
     following the "ES_info_length" field. The <span>text track in-band metadata track dispatch
     type</span> must be set to the concatenation of the <var>stream type</var> byte and
     the zero or more <var>descriptor bytes</var> bytes, expressed in hexadecimal using
     <span>uppercase ASCII hex digits</span>. <ref spec=MPEG2>

     </dd>

     <dt>If the <span>media resource</span> is an MPEG-4 file</dt>

     <dd>Let the
     first <code data-x="">stsd</code> box of the
     first <code data-x="">stbl</code> box of the
     first <code data-x="">minf</code> box of the
     first <code data-x="">mdia</code> box of the
     <span>text track</span>'s <code data-x="">trak</code> box in the
     first <code data-x="">moov</code> box
     of the file be the <i>stsd box</i>, if any.

     If the file has no <i>stsd box</i>, or if the <i>stsd box</i> has neither a <code
     data-x="">mett</code> box nor a <code data-x="">metx</code> box, then the <span>text track
     in-band metadata track dispatch type</span> must be set to the empty string.

     Otherwise, if the <i>stsd box</i> has a <code data-x="">mett</code> box then the <span>text
     track in-band metadata track dispatch type</span> must be set to the concatenation of the
     string "<code data-x="">mett</code>", a U+0020 SPACE character, and the value of the first <code
     data-x="">mime_format</code> field of the first <code data-x="">mett</code> box of the <i>stsd
     box</i>, or the empty string if that field is absent in that box.

     Otherwise, if the <i>stsd box</i> has no <code data-x="">mett</code> box but has a <code
     data-x="">metx</code> box then the <span>text track in-band metadata track dispatch type</span>
     must be set to the concatenation of the string "<code data-x="">metx</code>", a U+0020 SPACE
     character, and the value of the first <code data-x="">namespace</code> field of the first <code
     data-x="">metx</code> box of the <i>stsd box</i>, or the empty string if that field is absent in
     that box.

   <li><p>Populate the new <span>text track</span>'s <span data-x="text track list of cues">list of
   cues</span> with the cues parsed so far, following the <span>guidelines for exposing
   cues</span>, and begin updating it dynamically as necessary.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the new <span>text track</span>'s <span data-x="text track readiness state">readiness
   state</span> to <span data-x="text track loaded">loaded</span>.</p></li> <!-- otherwise, you'll
   have to load the whole media file just to start playing the first frame... -->

   <li><p>Set the new <span>text track</span>'s <span data-x="text track mode">mode</span> to the
   mode consistent with the user's preferences and the requirements of the relevant specification
   for the data.</p>

    <p class="note">For instance, if there are no other active subtitles, and this is a forced
    subtitle track (a subtitle track giving subtitles in the audio track's primary language, but
    only for audio that is actually in another language), then those subtitles might be activated
    here.</p>

   </li> <!-- it's too late to apply the normal heuristic, so we don't bother -->

   <li><p>Add the new <span>text track</span> to the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text

   <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code

  <!-- removetrack: we don't currently ever remove an in-band text track, because it might have been
  manipulated or might be about to be manipulated. If we made in-band text tracks readonly, we could
  probably get away with cleaning them up when they fall into the time before the earliest possible
  position and are known to be over and done with. -->

  <!-- if, after in-band text tracks have been found, there's no out-of-band text tracks, then apply
  user prefs? -->
