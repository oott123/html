  <h6>Sourcing out-of-band text tracks</h6>

  <p>When a <code>track</code> element is created, it must be associated with a new <span>text
  track</span> (with its value set as defined below) and its corresponding new
  <code>TextTrack</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <span>text track kind</span> is determined from the state of the element's <code
  data-x="attr-track-kind">kind</code> attribute according to the following table; for a state given
  in a cell of the first column, the <span data-x="text track kind">kind</span> is the string given
  in the second column:</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>State
     <th>String
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-track-kind-subtitles">Subtitles</span>
     <td><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-subtitles">subtitles</code>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-track-kind-captions">Captions</span>
     <td><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-captions">captions</code>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-track-kind-descriptions">Descriptions</span>
     <td><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-descriptions">descriptions</code>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-track-kind-chapters">Chapters</span>
     <td><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-chapters">chapters</code>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-track-kind-metadata">Metadata</span>
     <td><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-metadata">metadata</code>
  </table>

  <p>The <span>text track label</span> is the element's <span>track label</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>text track language</span> is the element's <span>track language</span>, if any, or
  the empty string otherwise.</p>

  <p>As the <code data-x="attr-track-kind">kind</code>, <code data-x="attr-track-label">label</code>,
  and <code data-x="attr-track-srclang">srclang</code> attributes are set, changed, or removed, the
  <span>text track</span> must update accordingly, as per the definitions above.</p>

  <p class="note">Changes to the <span>track URL</span> are handled in the algorithm below.</p>

  <p>The <span>text track readiness state</span> is initially <span data-x="text track not
  loaded">not loaded</span>, and the <span>text track mode</span> is initially <span data-x="text
  track disabled">disabled</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>text track list of cues</span> is initially empty. It is dynamically modified when
  the referenced file is parsed. Associated with the list are the <span>rules for updating the text
  track rendering</span> appropriate for the format in question; for WebVTT, this is the <span>rules
  for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</span>. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p>

  <p>When a <code>track</code> element's parent element changes and the new parent is a <span>media
  element</span>, then the user agent must add the <code>track</code> element's corresponding
  <span>text track</span> to the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span>, and
  then <span>queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named
  <code data-x="event-media-addtrack">addtrack</code> at the <span>media element</span>'s <code
  data-x="dom-media-textTracks">textTracks</code> attribute's <code>TextTrackList</code> object,
  using <code>TrackEvent</code>, with the <code data-x="dom-TrackEvent-track">track</code> attribute
  initialized to the <span>text track</span>'s <code>TextTrack</code> object.</p>

  <p>When a <code>track</code> element's parent element changes and the old parent was a <span>media
  element</span>, then the user agent must remove the <code>track</code> element's corresponding
  <span>text track</span> from the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span>,
  and then <span>queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named
  <code data-x="event-media-removetrack">removetrack</code> at the <span>media element</span>'s
  <code data-x="dom-media-textTracks">textTracks</code> attribute's <code>TextTrackList</code>
  object, using <code>TrackEvent</code>, with the <code data-x="dom-TrackEvent-track">track</code>
  attribute initialized to the <span>text track</span>'s <code>TextTrack</code> object.</p>
  <!-- removetrack -->

  <hr>

  <p>When a <span>text track</span> corresponding to a <code>track</code> element is added to a
  <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span>, the user agent must <span>queue a
  task</span> to run the following steps for the <span>media element</span>:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element's <span>blocked-on-parser</span> flag is true, abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's <span>did-perform-automatic-track-selection</span> flag is true, abort
   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Honor user preferences for automatic text track selection</span> for this
   element.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn>honor user preferences for automatic text track
  selection</dfn> for a <span>media element</span>, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Perform automatic text track selection</span> for <code
   data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-subtitles">subtitles</code> and <code
   data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-captions">captions</code>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Perform automatic text track selection</span> for <code
   data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-descriptions">descriptions</code>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Perform automatic text track selection</span> for <code
   data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-chapters">chapters</code>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there are any <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> in the <span>media
   element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span> whose <span>text track kind</span> is <code
   data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-metadata">metadata</code> that correspond to <code>track</code>
   elements with a <code data-x="attr-track-default">default</code> attribute set whose <span>text
   track mode</span> is set to <span data-x="text track disabled">disabled</span>, then set the
   <span>text track mode</span> of all such tracks to <span data-x="text track
   hidden">hidden</span></p></li>

   <li><p>Set the element's <span>did-perform-automatic-track-selection</span> flag to
   true.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the steps above say to <dfn>perform automatic text track selection</dfn> for one or more
  <span data-x="text track kind">text track kinds</span>, it means to run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>candidates</var> be a list consisting of the <span data-x="text
   track">text tracks</span> in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text tracks</span>
   whose <span>text track kind</span> is one of the kinds that were passed to the algorithm, if any,
   in the order given in the <span>list of text tracks</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>candidates</var> is empty, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If any of the <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> in <var>candidates</var> have a <span>text track mode</span> set to <span data-x="text track
   showing">showing</span>, abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the user has expressed an interest in having a track from <var>candidates</var>
    enabled based on its <span>text track kind</span>, <span>text track language</span>, and
    <span>text track label</span>, then set its <span>text track mode</span> to <span data-x="text
    track showing">showing</span><!--, and if there are any <span data-x="text track">text
    tracks</span> in <var>candidates</var> that correspond to <code>track</code> elements
    with a <code data-x="attr-track-default">default</code> attribute set whose <span>text track
    mode</span> is set to <span data-x="text track disabled">disabled</span>, then additionally set
    the <span>text track mode</span> of the first such track to <span data-x="text track
    hidden">hidden</span>-->.</p> <!-- the idea behind the commented out stuff is that we still get
    events and stuff: we can expect authors to forget that default doesn't mean that it'll always be
    turned on, and that they'll still rely on events firing even if it doesn't show. But it is
    commented out, because we can equally expect authors to expect only one track is getting events,
    so we've got problems either way, and might as well go with the simpler behavior. -->

    <p class="note">For example, the user could have set a browser preference to the effect of "I
    want French captions whenever possible", or "If there is a subtitle track with 'Commentary' in
    the title, enable it", or "If there are audio description tracks available, enable one, ideally
    in Swiss German, but failing that in Standard Swiss German or Standard German".</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if there are any <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> in <var>candidates</var> that correspond to <code>track</code> elements with a <code
    data-x="attr-track-default">default</code> attribute set whose <span>text track mode</span> is
    set to <span data-x="text track disabled">disabled</span>, then set the <span>text track
    mode</span> of the first such track to <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span>.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>When a <span>text track</span> corresponding to a <code>track</code> element experiences any of
  the following circumstances, the user agent must <span>start the <code>track</code> processing
  model</span> for that <span>text track</span> and its <code>track</code> element:

  <ul>

   <li>The <code>track</code> element is created.</li>

   <li>The <span>text track</span> has its <span>text track mode</span> changed.</li>

   <li>The <code>track</code> element's parent element changes and the new parent is a <span>media
   element</span>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>start the <code>track</code> processing model</dfn> for a
  <span>text track</span> and its <code>track</code> element, it must run the following algorithm.
  This algorithm interacts closely with the <span>event loop</span> mechanism; in particular, it has
  a <span>synchronous section</span> (which is triggered as part of the <span>event loop</span>
  algorithm). The steps in that section are marked with &#x231B;.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If another occurrence of this algorithm is already running for this <span>text
   track</span> and its <code>track</code> element, abort these steps, letting that other algorithm
   take care of this element.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>text track</span>'s <span>text track mode</span> is not set to one of <span
   data-x="text track hidden">hidden</span> or <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span>, abort
   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>text track</span>'s <code>track</code> element does not have a <span>media
   element</span> as a parent, abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run the remainder of these steps <span>in parallel</span>, allowing whatever caused these steps to
   run to continue.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Top</i>: <span>Await a stable state</span>. The <span>synchronous section</span>
   consists of the following steps. (The steps in the <span>synchronous section</span> are marked
   with &#x231B;.)</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Set the <span>text track readiness state</span> to <span data-x="text track
   loading">loading</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>URL</var> be the <span>track URL</span> of the
   <code>track</code> element.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; If the <code>track</code> element's parent is a <span>media element</span> then
   let <var>corsAttributeState</var> be the state of the parent <span>media element</span>'s <code
   data-x="attr-media-crossorigin">crossorigin</code> content attribute. Otherwise, let
   <var>corsAttributeState</var> be <span data-x="attr-crossorigin-none">No CORS</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>End the <span>synchronous section</span>, continuing the remaining steps
   <span>in parallel</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>URL</var> is not the empty string, run these substeps:

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>request</var> be the result of <span
     data-x="create a potential-CORS request">creating a potential-CORS request</span> given
     <var>URL</var>, "<code data-x="">media</code>", and <var>corsAttributeState</var>, and with the
     <i>same-origin fallback flag</i> set.</p></li>

     <li><p>Set <var>request</var>'s <span data-x="concept-request-client">client</span> to the
     <code>track</code> element's <span>node document</span>'s <code>Window</code> object's
     <span>environment settings object</span> and <span data-x="concept-request-type">type</span> to
     "<code data-x="">track</code>".</p></li>

     <!--FETCH--><li><p><span data-x="concept-fetch">Fetch</span> <var>request</var>.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> <span data-x="queue a task">queued</span> by the
    fetching algorithm on the <span>networking task source</span> to process the data as it is being
    fetched must <!--<span data-x="Content-Type sniffing">-->determine the <!--computed--> type of
    the resource<!--</span>-->. If the <!--computed--> type of the resource is not a supported text
    track format, the load will fail, as described below. Otherwise, the resource's data must be
    passed to the appropriate parser (e.g., the <span>WebVTT parser</span><!-- if the file starts
    with the "<code data-x="">WEBVTT</code>" signature-->) as it is received, with the <span>text
    track list of cues</span> being used for that parser's output. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p><!-- see
    also critical block below, and the word "computed" in the paragraph after that -->

    <p class="note">The appropriate parser will incrementally update the <span>text track list of
    cues</span> during these <span>networking task
    source</span> <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>, as each such task is
    run with whatever data has been received from the network).</p>

    <p class="critical">This specification does not currently say whether or how to check the MIME
    types of text tracks, or whether or how to perform file type sniffing using the actual file
    data. Implementors differ in their intentions on this matter and it is therefore unclear what
    the right solution is. In the absence of any requirement here, the HTTP specification's strict
    requirement to follow the Content-Type header prevails ("Content-Type specifies the media type
    of the underlying data." ... "If and only if the media type is not given by a Content-Type
    field, the recipient MAY attempt to guess the media type via inspection of its content
    and<!---->/<!---->or the name extension(s) of the URI used to identify the resource.").</p>

    <p>If fetching fails for any reason (network error, the server returns an error code, CORS
    fails, etc), or if <var>URL</var> is the empty string, then <span>queue a task</span> to first
    change the <span>text track readiness state</span> to <span data-x="text track failed to
    load">failed to load</span> and then <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span>
    named <code data-x="event-track-error">error</code> at the <code>track</code> element. This
    <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> must use the <span>DOM manipulation task
    source</span>.</p>
    <!-- can't be the media element one, since there might not be a media element by this point -->

    <p>If fetching does not fail, but the <!--computed--> type of the resource is not a supported
    text track format, or the file was not successfully processed (e.g., the format in question is
    an XML format and the file contained a well-formedness error that the XML specification requires
    be detected and reported to the application), then the <span data-x="concept-task">task</span>
    that is <span data-x="queue a task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task source</span> in
    which the aforementioned problem is found must change the <span>text track readiness
    state</span> to <span data-x="text track failed to load">failed to load</span> and <span
    data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
    data-x="event-track-error">error</code> at the <code>track</code> element.</p>

    <p>If fetching does not fail, and the file was successfully processed, then the final <span
    data-x="concept-task">task</span> that is <span data-x="queue a task">queued</span> by the
    <span>networking task source</span>, after it has finished parsing the data, must change the
    <span>text track readiness state</span> to <span data-x="text track loaded">loaded</span>, and
    <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
    data-x="event-track-load">load</code> at the <code>track</code> element.</p>

    <p>If, while fetching is ongoing, either:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>the <span>track URL</span> changes so that it is no longer equal to <var>URL</var>, while the <span>text track mode</span> is set to <span data-x="text track
     hidden">hidden</span> or <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span>; or</li>

     <li>the <span>text track mode</span> changes to <span data-x="text track hidden">hidden</span>
     or <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span>, while the <span>track URL</span> is not
     equal to <var>URL</var></li>

    </ul>

    <p>...then the user agent must abort <span data-x="concept-fetch">fetching</span>, discarding
    any pending <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> generated by that algorithm (and
    in particular, not adding any cues to the <span>text track list of cues</span> after the moment
    the URL changed), and then <span>queue a task</span> that first changes the <span>text track
    readiness state</span> to <span data-x="text track failed to load">failed to load</span> and
    then <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fires an event</span> named <code
    data-x="event-track-error">error</code> at the <code>track</code> element. This <span
    data-x="concept-task">task</span> must use the <span>DOM manipulation task source</span>. <!--
    can't be the media element one, since there might not be a media element by this point --></p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Wait until the <span>text track readiness state</span> is no longer set to <span
   data-x="text track loading">loading</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Wait until the <span>track URL</span> is no longer equal to <var>URL</var>, at
   the same time as the <span>text track mode</span> is set to <span data-x="text track
   hidden">hidden</span> or <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Jump to the step labeled <i>top</i>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>Whenever a <code>track</code> element has its <code data-x="attr-track-src">src</code> attribute
  set, changed, or removed, the user agent must <span>immediately</span> empty the element's <span>text
  track</span>'s <span>text track list of cues</span>. (This also causes the algorithm above to stop
  adding cues from the resource being obtained using the previously given URL, if any.)</p>
