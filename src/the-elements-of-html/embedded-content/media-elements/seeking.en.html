  <dl class="domintro">

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code></dt>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code></dt>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-fastSeek">fastSeek</code>( <var>time</var> )</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Seeks to near the given <var>time</var> as fast as possible, trading precision for
    speed. (To seek to a precise time, use the <code

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code></dfn> attribute must initially have the
  value false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-fastSeek">fastSeek()</code></dfn> method must <span
  data-x="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the time given by the method's argument, with the
  <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag set.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn data-x="dom-media-seek">seek</dfn> to a particular <var>new playback position</var> in the <span>media resource</span>, optionally with the
  <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag set, it means that the user agent must run the following steps.
  This algorithm interacts closely with the <span>event loop</span> mechanism; in particular, it has
  a <span>synchronous section</span> (which is triggered as part of the <span>event loop</span>
  algorithm). Steps in that section are marked with &#x231B;.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set the <span>media element</span>'s <span>show poster flag</span> to false.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span>'s <code data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code>
   is <code data-x="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code>, abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's <code data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> IDL attribute is true,
   then another instance of this algorithm is already running. Abort that other instance of the
   algorithm without waiting for the step that it is running to complete.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <code data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> IDL attribute to true.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the seek was in response to a DOM method call or setting of an IDL attribute, then
   continue the script. The remainder of these steps must be run <span>in parallel</span>. With the exception
   of the steps marked with &#x231B;, they could be aborted at any time by another instance of this
   algorithm being invoked.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>new playback position</var> is later than the end of the <span>media
   resource</span>, then let it be the end of the <span>media resource</span> instead.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>new playback position</var> is less than the <span>earliest possible
   position</span>, let it be that position instead.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the (possibly now changed) <var>new playback position</var> is not in one of
   the ranges given in the <code data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute, then let it
   be the position in one of the ranges given in the <code
   data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute that is the nearest to the <var>new
   playback position</var>. If two positions both satisfy that constraint (i.e. the <var>new playback position</var> is exactly in the middle between two ranges in the <code
   data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute) then use the position that is closest to
   the <span>current playback position</span>. If there are no ranges given in the <code
   data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute then set the <code
   data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> IDL attribute to false and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag is set, adjust the <var>new playback
    position</var> to a value that will allow for playback to resume promptly. If <var>new
    playback position</var> before this step is before <span>current playback position</span>, then
    the adjusted <var>new playback position</var> must also be before the <span>current
    playback position</span>. Similarly, if the <var>new playback position</var> before
    this step is after <span>current playback position</span>, then the adjusted <var>new
    playback position</var> must also be after the <span>current playback position</span>.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, the user agent could snap to a nearby key frame, so that it
    doesn't have to spend time decoding then discarding intermediate frames before resuming
    playback.</p>

    </li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named
   <code data-x="event-media-seeking">seeking</code> at the element.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Set the <span>current playback position</span> to the <var>new playback
    position</var>.</p>

    <p class="note">If the <span>media element</span> was <span>potentially playing</span>
    immediately before it started seeking, but seeking caused its <code
    data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute to change to a value lower than <code
    data-x="dom-media-HAVE_FUTURE_DATA">HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>, then a <code
    data-x="event-media-waiting">waiting</code> event <a href="#fire-waiting-when-waiting">will be
    fired</a> at the element.</p> <!-- also, timeupdate -->

    <p class="note">This step sets the <span>current playback position</span>, and thus can
    immediately trigger other conditions, such as the rules regarding when playback "<a
    href="#reaches-the-end">reaches the end of the media resource</a>" (part of the logic that
    handles looping), even before the user agent is actually able to render the media data for that
    position (as determined in the next step).</p>

    <p class="note">The <code data-x="dom-media-currentTime">currentTime</code> attribute returns
    the <span>official playback position</span>, not the <span>current playback position</span>, and
    therefore gets updated before script execution, separate from this algorithm.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Wait until the user agent has established whether or not the <span>media data</span> for
   the <var>new playback position</var> is available, and, if it is, until it has decoded
   enough data to play back that position.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Await a stable state</span>. The <span>synchronous section</span> consists of all
   the remaining steps of this algorithm. (Steps in the <span>synchronous section</span> are marked
   with &#x231B;.)</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Set the <code data-x="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> IDL attribute to
   false.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Run the <span>time marches on</span> steps.</p></li>

   <li id="seekUpdate"><p>&#x231B; <span>Queue a task</span> to <span
   data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; <span>Queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an
   event</span> named <code data-x="event-media-seeked">seeked</code> at the element.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code></dfn> attribute must return a new
  static <span>normalized <code>TimeRanges</code> object</span> that represents the ranges of the
  <span>media resource</span>, if any, that the user agent is able to seek to, at the time the
  attribute is evaluated.</p>

  <p class="note">If the user agent can seek to anywhere in the <span>media resource</span>, e.g.
  because it is a simple movie file and the user agent and the server support HTTP Range requests,
  then the attribute would return an object with one range, whose start is the time of the first
  frame (the <span>earliest possible position</span>, typically zero), and whose end is the same as
  the time of the first frame plus the <code data-x="dom-media-duration">duration</code> attribute's
  value (which would equal the time of the last frame, and might be positive Infinity).</p>

  <p class="note">The range might be continuously changing, e.g. if the user agent is buffering a
  sliding window on an infinite stream. This is the behavior seen with DVRs viewing live TV, for
  instance.</p>

  <p>User agents should adopt a very liberal and optimistic view of what is seekable. User
  agents should also buffer recent content where possible to enable seeking to be fast.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, consider a large video file served on an HTTP server without
  support for HTTP Range requests. A browser <em>could</em> implement this by only buffering the
  current frame and data obtained for subsequent frames, never allow seeking, except for seeking to
  the very start by restarting the playback. However, this would be a poor implementation. A high
  quality implementation would buffer the last few minutes of content (or more, if sufficient
  storage space is available), allowing the user to jump back and rewatch something surprising
  without any latency, and would in addition allow arbitrary seeking by reloading the file from the
  start if necessary, which would be slower but still more convenient than having to literally
  restart the video and watch it all the way through just to get to an earlier unbuffered spot.</p>

  <p><span data-x="media resource">Media resources</span> might be internally scripted or
  interactive. Thus, a <span>media element</span> could play in a non-linear fashion. If this
  happens, the user agent must act as if the algorithm for <span
  data-x="dom-media-seek">seeking</span> was used whenever the <span>current playback position</span>
  changes in a discontinuous fashion (so that the relevant events fire).</p>
