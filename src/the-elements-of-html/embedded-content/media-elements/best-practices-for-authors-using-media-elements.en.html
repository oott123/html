  <h5>Best practices for authors using media elements</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Playing audio and video resources on small devices such as set-top boxes or mobile phones is
  often constrained by limited hardware resources in the device. For example, a device might only
  support three simultaneous videos. For this reason, it is a good practice to release resources
  held by <span data-x="media element">media elements</span> when they are done playing, either by
  being very careful about removing all references to the element and allowing it to be garbage
  collected, or, even better, by removing the element's <code data-x="attr-media-src">src</code>
  attribute and any <code>source</code> element descendants, and invoking the element's <code
  data-x="dom-media-load">load()</code> method.</p>

  <p>Similarly, when the playback rate is not exactly 1.0, hardware, software, or format limitations
  can cause video frames to be dropped and audio to be choppy or muted.</p>
