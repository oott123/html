<h5>Playing the media resource</h5>

  <dl class="domintro">

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Returns true if playback is paused; false otherwise.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-ended">ended</code></dt>

    <p>Can be set, to change the default rate of playback.</p>

    <p>The default rate has no direct effect on playback, but if the user switches to a fast-forward

    <p>Can be set, to change the rate of playback.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-played">played</code></dt>

   <dd>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-play">play</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Sets the <code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> attribute to false, loading the

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code></dfn> attribute represents whether the
  <span>media element</span> is paused or not. The attribute must initially be true.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is a <dfn>blocked media element</dfn> if its <code
  data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is in the <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code> state, the <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code> state, or the <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_CURRENT_DATA">HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> state, or if the element has
  <span>paused for user interaction</span> or <span>paused for in-band content</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to be <dfn>potentially playing</dfn> when its <code
  data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> attribute is false, the element has not <span>ended
  playback</span>, playback has not <span>stopped due to errors</span>, and the element is not a
  <span>blocked media element</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">A <code data-x="event-media-waiting">waiting</code> DOM event <a
  href="#fire-waiting-when-waiting">can be fired</a> as a result of an element that is
  <span>potentially playing</span> stopping playback due to its <code
  data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute changing to a value lower than <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_FUTURE_DATA">HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to be <dfn>eligible for autoplay</dfn> when its
  <span>autoplaying flag</span> is true, its <code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> attribute
  is true, the element has an <code data-x="attr-media-autoplay">autoplay</code> attribute
  specified, and the element's <span>node document</span>'s <span>active sandboxing flag set</span>
  does not have the <span>sandboxed automatic features browsing context flag</span> set.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to be <dfn>allowed to play</dfn> if the user agent and the
  system allow media playback in the current context.</p>

  <p class="note">For example, a user agent could require that playback is <span>triggered by user
  activation</span>, but an exception could be made to allow playback while <span
  data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to have <dfn>ended playback</dfn> when:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The element's <code data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is <code
   data-x="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code> or greater, and

   <li>

    <p>Either:

    <ul>

     <li>The <span>current playback position</span> is the end of the <span>media resource</span>,
     and

     <li>The <span>direction of playback</span> is forwards, and

     <li>The <span>media element</span> does not have a <code data-x="attr-media-loop">loop</code>
     attribute specified.

    </ul>

    <p>Or:

    <ul>

     <li>The <span>current playback position</span> is the <span>earliest possible position</span>,
     and

     <li>The <span>direction of playback</span> is backwards.

    </ul>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-ended">ended</code></dfn> attribute must return true if, the
  last time the <span>event loop</span> reached <a href="#step1">step 1</a>, the <span>media element</span> had
  <span>ended playback</span> and the <span>direction of playback</span> was forwards, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to have <dfn>stopped due to errors</dfn> when the
  element's <code data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code> or greater, and the user agent <a
  href="#non-fatal-media-error">encounters a non-fatal error</a> during the processing of the
  <span>media data</span>, and due to that error, is not able to play the content at the
  <span>current playback position</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to have <dfn>paused for user interaction</dfn> when its
  <code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> attribute is false, the <code
  data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is either <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_FUTURE_DATA">HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA">HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code> and the user agent has reached a point
  in the <span>media resource</span> where the user has to make a selection for the resource to
  continue.</p>

  <p>It is possible for a <span>media element</span> to have both <span>ended playback</span> and
  <span>paused for user interaction</span> at the same time.</p>

  <p>When a <span>media element</span> that is <span>potentially playing</span> stops playing
  because it has <span>paused for user interaction</span>, the user agent must <span>queue a
  task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to have <dfn>paused for in-band content</dfn> when its
  <code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> attribute is false, the <code
  data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is either <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_FUTURE_DATA">HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA">HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code> and the user agent has suspended
  playback of the <span>media resource</span> in order to play content that is temporally anchored
  to the <span>media resource</span> and has a non-zero length, or to play content that is
  temporally anchored to a segment of the <span>media resource</span> but has a length longer than
  that segment.</p>

  <p class="example">One example of when a <span>media element</span> would be <span>paused for
  in-band content</span> is when the user agent is playing <span
  data-x="attr-track-kind-descriptions">audio descriptions</span> from an external WebVTT file, and
  the synthesized speech generated for a cue is longer than the time between the <span>text track
  cue start time</span> and the <span>text track cue end time</span>.</p>

  <p>If the element's <code data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> is positive or zero,
  then the <dfn>direction of playback</dfn> is forwards. Otherwise, it is backwards.</p>

  <p id="media-playback">When a <span>media element</span> is <span>potentially playing</span> and
  its <code>Document</code> is a <span>fully active</span> <code>Document</code>, its <span>current
  playback position</span> must increase monotonically at the element's <code
  data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> units of media time per unit time of the
  <span>media timeline</span>'s clock. (This specification always refers to this as an
  <i>increase</i>, but that increase could actually be a <em>de</em>crease if the element's <code
  data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> is negative.)</p>

  <p class="note">The element's <code data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> can be
  0.0, in which case the <span>current playback position</span> doesn't move, despite playback not
  being paused (<code data-x="dom-media-paused">paused</code> doesn't become true, and the <code
  data-x="event-media-pause">pause</code> event doesn't fire).</p>

  <p class="note">This specification doesn't define how the user agent achieves the appropriate
  playback rate &mdash; depending on the protocol and media available, it is plausible that the user
  agent could negotiate with the server to have the server provide the media data at the appropriate
  rate, so that (except for the period between when the rate is changed and when the server updates
  the stream's playback rate) the client doesn't actually have to drop or interpolate any
  frames.</p>

  <p>Any time the user agent <span data-x="await a stable state">provides a stable state</span>,
  the <span>official playback position</span> must be set to the <span>current playback
  position</span>.</p> <!-- cross-ref is intentionally to the other term, to help find this -->

  <p>While the <span>direction of playback</span> is backwards, any corresponding audio must be
  <span data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>. While the element's <code
  data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> is so low or so high that the user agent
  cannot play audio usefully, the corresponding audio must also be <span
  data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>. If the element's <code
  data-x="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> is not 1.0, the user agent may apply pitch
  adjustments to the audio as necessary to render it faithfully.</p>

  <p><span data-x="media element">Media elements</span> that are <span>potentially playing</span>
  while not <span>in a document</span> must not play any video, but should play any audio component.
  Media elements must not stop playing just because all references to them have been removed; only
  once a media element is in a state where no further audio could ever be played by that element may
  the element be garbage collected.</p>

  <p class="note">It is possible for an element to which no explicit references exist to play audio,
  even if such an element is not still actively playing: for instance, it could be unpaused but
  stalled waiting for content to buffer, or it could be still buffering, but with a
  <code data-x="event-media-suspend">suspend</code> event listener that begins playback. Even a
  media element whose <span>media resource</span> has no audio tracks could eventually play audio
  again if it had an event listener that changes the <span>media resource</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <span>media element</span> has a <dfn>list of newly introduced cues</dfn>, which must be
  initially empty. Whenever a <span>text track cue</span> is added to the <span data-x="text track
  list of cues">list of cues</span> of a <span>text track</span> that is in the <span>list of text
  tracks</span> for a <span>media element</span>, that <span data-x="text track cue">cue</span> must
  be added to the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of newly introduced cues</span>. Whenever
  a <span>text track</span> is added to the <span>list of text tracks</span> for a <span>media
  element</span>, all of the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> in that <span>text
  track</span>'s <span data-x="text track list of cues">list of cues</span> must be added to the
  <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of newly introduced cues</span>. When a <span>media
  element</span>'s <span>list of newly introduced cues</span> has new cues added while the
  <span>media element</span>'s <span>show poster flag</span> is not set, then the user agent must
  run the <i data-x="time marches on">time marches on</i> steps.</p>

  <p>When a <span>text track cue</span> is removed from the <span data-x="text track list of
  cues">list of cues</span> of a <span>text track</span> that is in the <span>list of text
  tracks</span> for a <span>media element</span>, and whenever a <span>text track</span> is removed
  from the <span>list of text tracks</span> of a <span>media element</span>, if the <span>media
  element</span>'s <span>show poster flag</span> is not set, then the user agent must run the
  <i data-x="time marches on">time marches on</i> steps.</p>

  <p>When the <span>current playback position</span> of a <span>media element</span> changes (e.g.
  due to playback or seeking), the user agent must run the <i data-x="time marches on">time marches on</i> steps. If the
  <span>current playback position</span> changes while the steps are running, then the user agent
  must wait for the steps to complete, and then must immediately rerun the steps. (These steps are
  thus run as often as possible or needed &mdash; if one iteration takes a long time, this can cause
  certain <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> to be skipped over as the user agent rushes ahead
  to "catch up".)</p>

  <p>The <dfn><i>time marches on</i></dfn> steps are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>current cues</var> be a list of <span data-x="text track
   cue">cues</span>, initialized to contain all the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> of all
   the <span data-x="text track hidden">hidden</span> or <span data-x="text track
   showing">showing</span> <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> of the <span>media
   element</span> (not the <span data-x="text track disabled">disabled</span> ones) whose <span
   data-x="text track cue start time">start times</span> are less than or equal to the <span>current
   playback position</span> and whose <span data-x="text track cue end time">end times</span> are
   greater than the <span>current playback position</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>other cues</var> be a list of <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span>,
   initialized to contain all the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> of <span data-x="text
   track hidden">hidden</span> and <span data-x="text track showing">showing</span> <span data-x="text
   track">text tracks</span> of the <span>media element</span> that are not present in <var>current cues</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>last time</var> be the <span>current playback position</span> at the
   time this algorithm was last run for this <span>media element</span>, if this is not the first
   time it has run.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>current playback position</span> has, since the last time this algorithm was
   run, only changed through its usual monotonic increase during normal playback, then let <var>missed cues</var> be the list of <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> in <var>other cues</var> whose <span data-x="text track cue start time">start times</span> are
   greater than or equal to <var>last time</var> and whose <span data-x="text track cue end
   time">end times</span> are less than or equal to the <span>current playback position</span>.
   Otherwise, let <var>missed cues</var> be an empty list.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove all the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> in <var>missed cues</var>
   that are also in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of newly introduced cues</span>, and
   then empty the element's <span>list of newly introduced cues</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the time was reached through the usual monotonic increase of the <span>current playback
   position</span> during normal playback, and if the user agent has not fired a <code
   data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> event at the element in the past 15 to 250ms and
   is not still running event handlers for such an event, then the user agent must <span>queue a
   task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element. (In the other cases, such as
   explicit seeks, relevant events get fired as part of the overall process of changing the
   <span>current playback position</span>.)</p>

   <p class="note">The event thus is not to be fired faster than about 66Hz or slower than 4Hz
   (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to
   vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the
   event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can
   comfortably handle while decoding the video.</p></li>

   <li><p>If all of the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> in <var>current cues</var>
   have their <span>text track cue active flag</span> set, none of the <span data-x="text track
   cue">cues</span> in <var>other cues</var> have their <span>text track cue active
   flag</span> set, and <var>missed cues</var> is empty, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the time was reached through the usual monotonic increase of the <span>current playback
    position</span> during normal playback, and there are <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span>
    in <var>other cues</var> that have their <span>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</span>
    set and that either have their <span>text track cue active flag</span> set or are also in <var>missed cues</var>, then <span>immediately</span> <span data-x="dom-media-pause">pause</span> the
    <span>media element</span>. <!-- "pause" can in theory call load(), but never can it do so as
    part of this invocation, since we wouldn't be in this algorithm if the media element was empty.
    So, no need to couch all this in a task. --></p>

    <p class="note">In the other cases, such as explicit seeks, playback is not paused by going past
    the end time of a <span data-x="text track cue">cue</span>, even if that <span data-x="text track
    cue">cue</span> has its <span>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</span> set.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>events</var> be a list of <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>,
    initially empty. Each <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> in this list will be associated
    with a <span>text track</span>, a <span>text track cue</span>, and a time, which are used to
    sort the list before the <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> are queued.</p>

    <p>Let <var>affected tracks</var> be a list of <span data-x="text track">text
    tracks</span>, initially empty.</p>

    <p>When the steps below say to <dfn>prepare an event</dfn> named <var>event</var> for a
    <span>text track cue</span> <var>target</var> with a time <var>time</var>, the
    user agent must run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var>track</var> be the <span>text track</span> with which the <span>text
     track cue</span> <var>target</var> is associated.</p></li>

     <li><p>Create a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> to <span
     data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <var>event</var> at
     <var>target</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Add the newly created <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> to <var>events</var>, associated with the time <var>time</var>, the <span>text
     track</span> <var>track</var>, and the <span>text track cue</span> <var>target</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Add <var>track</var> to <var>affected tracks</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>For each <span data-x="text track cue">text track cue</span> in <var>missed
   cues</var>, <span>prepare an event</span> named <code data-x="event-media-enter">enter</code> for the
   <code>TextTrackCue</code> object with the <span>text track cue start time</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>For each <span data-x="text track cue">text track cue</span> in <var>other
   cues</var> that either has its <span>text track cue active flag</span> set or is in <var>missed cues</var>, <span>prepare an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-media-exit">exit</code> for the <code>TextTrackCue</code> object with the later of the
   <span>text track cue end time</span> and the <span>text track cue start time</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>For each <span data-x="text track cue">text track cue</span> in <var>current
   cues</var> that does not have its <span>text track cue active flag</span> set, <span>prepare an
   event</span> named <code data-x="event-media-enter">enter</code> for the <code>TextTrackCue</code>
   object with the <span>text track cue start time</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Sort the <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> in <var>events</var> in ascending
    time order (<span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> with earlier times first).</p>

    <p>Further sort <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> in <var>events</var> that have
    the same time by the relative <span>text track cue order</span> of the <span data-x="text track
    cue">text track cues</span> associated with these <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>.</p>

    <p>Finally, sort <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> in <var>events</var> that have
    the same time and same <span>text track cue order</span> by placing <span
    data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that fire <code data-x="event-media-enter">enter</code> events before
    those that fire <code data-x="event-media-exit">exit</code> events.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p><span data-x="queue a task">Queue</span> each <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> in
   <var>events</var>, in list order.</p></li>

   <li><p>Sort <var>affected tracks</var> in the same order as the <span data-x="text
   track">text tracks</span> appear in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text
   tracks</span>, and remove duplicates.</p>

   <li><p>For each <span>text track</span> in <var>affected tracks</var>, in the list
   order, <span>queue a task</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named
   <code data-x="event-media-cuechange">cuechange</code> at the <code>TextTrack</code> object, and,
   if the <span>text track</span> has a corresponding <code>track</code> element, to then <span
   data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-media-cuechange">cuechange</code> at the <code>track</code> element as
   well.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>text track cue active flag</span> of all the <span data-x="text track
   cue">cues</span> in the <var>current cues</var>, and unset the <span>text track cue
   active flag</span> of all the <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> in the <var>other
   cues</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run the <span>rules for updating the text track rendering</span> of each of the <span
   data-x="text track">text tracks</span> in <var>affected tracks</var> that are <span data-x="text
   track showing">showing</span>, providing the <span>text track</span>'s <span>text track
   language</span> as the fallback language if it is not the empty string. For example, for <span
   data-x="text track">text tracks</span> based on WebVTT, the <span>rules for updating the display
   of WebVTT text tracks</span>. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>For the purposes of the algorithm above, a <span>text track cue</span> is considered to be part
  of a <span>text track</span> only if it is listed in the <span>text track list of cues</span>, not
  merely if it is associated with the <span>text track</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">If the <span>media element</span>'s <span>node document</span> stops being a
  <span>fully active</span> document, then the playback will <a href="#media-playback">stop</a>
  until the document is active again.</p>

  <p>When a <span>media element</span> is <span data-x="node is removed from a document">removed
  from a <code>Document</code></span>, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Await a stable state</span>, allowing the <span
   data-x="concept-task">task</span> that removed the <span>media element</span> from the
   <code>Document</code> to continue. The <span>synchronous section</span> consists of all the
   remaining steps of this algorithm. (Steps in the <span>synchronous section</span> are marked with
   &#x231B;.)</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; If the <span>media element</span> is <span>in a document</span>, abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Run the <span>internal pause steps</span> for the <span>media element</span>.</p>

  </ol>
