<h5>Video and audio codecs for <code>video</code> elements</h5>

  <p>User agents may support any video and audio codecs and container formats.</p>

  <p class="note">Certain user agents might support no codecs at all, e.g. text browsers running
  over SSH connections.</p>

  <!- - similar note in audio codecs section - ->
  <p class="note">Implementations are free to implement support for video codecs either natively, or
  using platform-specific APIs, or using plugins: this specification does not specify how codecs are
  to be implemented.</p>
