  <h6>A graphical representation of some of the surrounding text</h6>

  <p>In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and its presence merely reinforces the
  surrounding text. In these cases, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be
  present but its value must be the empty string.</p>

  <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the image doesn't make the page any
  less useful, but including the image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to
  understand the concept.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>A flowchart that repeats the previous paragraph in graphical form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The Network passes data to the Input Stream Preprocessor, which
passes it to the Tokenizer, which passes it to the Tree Construction
stage. From there, data goes to both the DOM and to Script Execution.
Script Execution is linked to the DOM, and, using document.write(),
passes data to the Tokenizer.&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="">&lt;/p></strong></pre>

   <p>In these cases, it would be wrong to include alternative text that consists of just a caption.
   If a caption is to be included, then either the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute
   can be used, or the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> elements can be used. In the
   latter case, the image would in fact be a phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical
   representation, and would thus require alternative text.</p>
