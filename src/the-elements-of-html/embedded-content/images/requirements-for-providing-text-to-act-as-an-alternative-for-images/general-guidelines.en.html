<h6>General guidelines</h6>

  <p>Except where otherwise specified, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be
  specified and its value must not be empty; the value must be an appropriate replacement for the
  image. The specific requirements for the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute depend on
  what the image is intended to represent, as described in the following sections.</p>

  <p>The most general rule to consider when writing alternative text is the following: <strong>the
  intent is that replacing every image with the text of its <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute not change the meaning of the page</strong>.</p>

  <p>So, in general, alternative text can be written by considering what one would have written had
  one not been able to include the image.</p>

  <p>A corollary to this is that the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute's value should
  never contain text that could be considered the image's <em>caption</em>, <em>title</em>, or
  <em>legend</em>. It is supposed to contain replacement text that could be used by users
  <em>instead</em> of the image; it is not meant to supplement the image. The <code
  data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute can be used for supplemental information.</p>

  <p>Another corollary is that the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute's value should
  not repeat information that is already provided in the prose next to the image.</p>

  <p class="note">One way to think of alternative text is to think about how you would read the page
  containing the image to someone over the phone, without mentioning that there is an image present.
  Whatever you say instead of the image is typically a good start for writing the alternative
  text.</p>
