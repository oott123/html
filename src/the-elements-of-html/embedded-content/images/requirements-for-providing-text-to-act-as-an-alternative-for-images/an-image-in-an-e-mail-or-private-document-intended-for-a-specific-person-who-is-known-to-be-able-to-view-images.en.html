  <h6>An image in an e-mail or private document intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images</h6>

  <p><i>This section does not apply to documents that are publicly accessible, or whose target
  audience is not necessarily personally known to the author, such as documents on a Web site,
  e-mails sent to public mailing lists, or software documentation.</i></p>

  <p>When an image is included in a private communication (such as an HTML e-mail) aimed at a
  specific person who is known to be able to view images, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute may be omitted. However, even in such cases authors are strongly urged to include
  alternative text (as appropriate according to the kind of image involved, as described in the
  above entries), so that the e-mail is still usable should the user use a mail client that does not
  support images, or should the document be forwarded on to other users whose abilities might not
  include easily seeing images.</p>
