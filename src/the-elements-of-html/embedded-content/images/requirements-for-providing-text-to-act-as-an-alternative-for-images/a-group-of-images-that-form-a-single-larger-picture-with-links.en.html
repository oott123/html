  <h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with links</h6>

  <p>Generally, <span data-x="image map">image maps</span> should be used instead of slicing an image
  for links.</p>

  <p>However, if an image is indeed sliced and any of the components of the sliced picture are the
  sole contents of links, then one image per link must have alternative text in its <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute representing the purpose of the link.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing the flying spaghetti monster emblem, with
   each of the left noodly appendages and the right noodly appendages in different images, so that
   the user can pick the left side or the right side in an adventure.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>The Church&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You come across a flying spaghetti monster. Which side of His
Noodliness do you wish to reach out for?&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;a href="?go=left" >&lt;img src="fsm-left.png"  alt="Left side. ">&lt;/a
  >&lt;img src="fsm-middle.png" alt=""
  >&lt;a href="?go=right">&lt;img src="fsm-right.png" alt="Right side.">&lt;/a>&lt;/p></strong></pre>

  </div>
