  <h6>A short phrase or label with an alternative graphical representation: icons, logos</h6>

  <p>A document can contain information in iconic form. The icon is intended to help users of visual
  browsers to recognize features at a glance.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the icon is supplemental to a text label conveying the same meaning. In those
  cases, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but must be empty.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here the icons are next to text that conveys the same meaning, so they have an empty <code
   data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;nav>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/help/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/help.png" alt=""></strong> Help&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/configure/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/configuration.png" alt=""></strong>
 Configuration Tools&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/nav></pre>

  </div>

  <p>In other cases, the icon has no text next to it describing what it means; the icon is supposed
  to be self-explanatory. In those cases, an equivalent textual label must be given in the <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, posts on a news site are labeled with an icon indicating their topic.</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>

   &lt;h1>Ratatouille wins &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="movies.png" alt="Movies"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>Pixar has won yet another &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award,
  making this its 8th win in the last 12 years.&lt;/p>

   &lt;h1>Latest TWiT episode is online&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="podcasts.png" alt="Podcasts"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>The latest TWiT episode has been posted, in which we hear
  several tech news stories as well as learning much more about the
  iPhone. This week, the panelists compare how reflective their
  iPhones' Apple logos are.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/article>
&lt;/body></pre>

  <p>Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which stand for a particular entity such
  as a company, organization, project, band, software package, country, or some such.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g. as a page heading, the <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must contain the name of the entity being represented by
  the logo. The <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must <em>not</em> contain text like
  the word "logo", as it is not the fact that it is a logo that is being conveyed, it's the entity
  itself.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used next to the name of the entity that it represents, then the logo is
  supplemental, and its <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must instead be empty.</p>

  <p>If the logo is merely used as decorative material (as branding, or, for example, as a side
  image in an article that mentions the entity to which the logo belongs), then the entry below on
  purely decorative images applies. If the logo is actually being discussed, then it is being used
  as a phrase or paragraph (the description of the logo) with an alternative graphical
  representation (the logo itself), and the first entry above applies.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippets, all four of the above cases are present. First, we see a logo used
   to represent a company:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="XYZ.gif" alt="The XYZ company"></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

   <p>Next, we see a paragraph which uses a logo right next to the company name, and so doesn't have
   any alternative text:

   <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h2>News&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>We have recently been looking at buying the <strong>&lt;img src="alpha.gif"
 alt=""> &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company</strong>, a small Greek company
 specializing in our type of product.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>In this third snippet, we have a logo being used in an aside, as part of the larger article
   discussing the acquisition:</p>

<pre> <strong>&lt;aside>&lt;p>&lt;img src="alpha-large.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>&lt;/aside></strong>
 &lt;p>The &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company has had a good quarter, and our
 pie chart studies of their accounts suggest a much bigger blue slice
 than its green and orange slices, which is always a good sign.&lt;/p>
&lt;/article></pre>

   <p>Finally, we have an opinion piece talking about a logo, and the logo is therefore described in
   detail in the alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Consider for a moment their logo:&lt;/p>

<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/images/logo" alt="It consists of a green circle with a
green question mark centered inside it.">&lt;/p></strong>

&lt;p>How unoriginal can you get? I mean, oooooh, a question mark, how
&lt;em>revolutionary&lt;/em>, how utterly &lt;em>ground-breaking&lt;/em>, I'm
sure everyone will rush to adopt those specifications now! They could
at least have tried for some sort of, I don't know, sequence of
rounded squares with varying shades of green and bold white outlines,
at least that would look good on the cover of a blue book.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This example shows how the alternative text should be written such that if the image isn't <i
   data-x="img-available">available</i>, and the text is used instead, the text flows seamlessly into
   the surrounding text, as if the image had never been there in the first place.</p>
