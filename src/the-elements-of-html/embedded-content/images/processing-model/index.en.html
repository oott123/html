  <p>The <span>task source</span> for the <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> <span data-x="queue
  a task">queued</span> by algorithms in this section is the <span>DOM manipulation task
  source</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>An <code>img</code> element has a <dfn>current request</dfn> and a <dfn>pending request</dfn>.
  The <span>current request</span> is initially set to a new <span>image request</span>.
  The <span>pending request</span> is initially set to null.
  The <span>current request</span> is usually referred to as the <code>img</code> element itself.</p>

  <p>An <dfn>image request</dfn> has a <dfn data-x="img-req-state">state</dfn>, <dfn data-x="img-req-url">current URL</dfn> and <dfn data-x="img-req-data">image data</dfn>.</p>

  <p>An <span>image request</span>'s <span data-x="img-req-state">state</span> is one of the following:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn data-x="img-none">Unavailable</dfn></dt>
   <dd>The user agent hasn't obtained any image data,
   or has obtained some or all of the image data but
   hasn't yet decoded enough of the image to get the image dimensions.</dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="img-inc">Partially available</dfn></dt>
   <dd>The user agent has obtained some of the image data and at least the image dimensions are
   available.</dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="img-all">Completely available</dfn></dt>
   <dd>The user agent has obtained all of the image data and at least the image dimensions are
   available.</dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="img-error">Broken</dfn></dt>
   <dd>The user agent has obtained all of the image data that it can, but it cannot even decode the
   image enough to get the image dimensions (e.g. the image is corrupted, or the format is not
   supported, or no data could be obtained).</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>An <span>image request</span>'s <span data-x="img-req-url">current URL</span> is initially the empty string.</p>

  <p>An <span>image request</span>'s <span data-x="img-req-data">image data</span> is the decoded image data.</p>

  <p>When an <span>image request</span> is either in the <span data-x="img-inc">partially
  available</span> state or in the <span data-x="img-all">completely available</span> state, it is
  said to be <dfn data-x="img-available">available</dfn>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element is in the <span data-x="img-all">completely available</span>
  state <em>and</em> the user agent can decode the media data without errors, then the
  <code>img</code> element is said to be <dfn data-x="img-good">fully decodable</dfn>.</p>

  <p>An <span>image request</span> is initially <span data-x="img-none">unavailable</span>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element is <span data-x="img-available">available</span>,
  it provides a <span>paint source</span>
  whose width is the image's <span data-x="density-corrected intrinsic width and height">density-corrected intrinsic width</span> (if any),
  whose height is the image's <span data-x="density-corrected intrinsic width and height">density-corrected intrinsic height</span> (if any),
  and whose appearance is the intrinsic appearance of the image.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>An <code>img</code> element is said to <dfn>use <code>srcset</code> or
  <code>picture</code></dfn> if it has a <code data-x="attr-img-srcset">srcset</code> attribute
  specified or if it has a parent that is a <code>picture</code> element.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <code>img</code> element has a <dfn>last selected source</dfn>, which must initially be
  null.</p>

  <p>Each <span>image request</span> has a <dfn>current pixel density</dfn>, which must initially be undefined.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element has a <span>current pixel density</span> that is not 1.0, the
  element's image data must be treated as if its resolution, in device pixels per <span
  data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>, was the <span>current pixel density</span>. The image's
  <dfn>density-corrected intrinsic width and height</dfn> are the <span data-x="intrinsic
  dimensions">intrinsic width and height</span> after taking into account the <span>current pixel
  density</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, if the <span>current pixel density</span> is 3.125, that means
  that there are 300 device pixels per <span data-x="'in'">CSS inch</span>, and thus if the image
  data is 300x600, it has <span>intrinsic dimensions</span> of 96 <span data-x="'px'">CSS
  pixels</span> by 192 <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>.</p>

  <p>An <code>img</code> element is associated with a <span>source set</span>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>source set</dfn> is an ordered set of zero or more <span data-x="image source">image sources</span>
  and a <span>source size</span>.</p>

  <p>An <dfn>image source</dfn> is a <span>URL</span>, and optionally either a <span>pixel density
  descriptor</span>, or a <span>width descriptor</span>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>source size</dfn> is a <span>&lt;source-size-value></span>.
  When a <span>source size</span> has a unit relative to the <span>viewport</span>,
  it must be interpreted relative to the <code>img</code> element's <span>node document</span>'s
  <span>viewport</span>.
  Other units must be interpreted the same as in Media Queries. <ref spec=MQ></p>

  <hr>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="concept-microsyntax-parse-error">parse error</dfn> for algorithms in this
  section indicates a non-fatal mismatch between input and requirements. User agents are encouraged
  to expose <span data-x="concept-microsyntax-parse-error">parse error</span>s somehow.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Whether the image is fetched successfully or not (e.g. whether the response status was an
  <span>ok status</span>) must be ignored when determining the image's type and whether it is a
  valid image.</p>

  <p class="note">This allows servers to return images with error responses, and have them
  displayed.</p>

  <p id="img-determine-type">The user agent should apply the <span data-x="Content-Type sniffing:
  image">image sniffing rules</span> to determine the type of the image, with the image's <span
  data-x="Content-Type">associated Content-Type headers</span> giving the <var>official
  type</var>. If these rules are not applied, then the type of the image must be the type given by
  the image's <span data-x="Content-Type">associated Content-Type headers</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents must not support non-image resources with the <code>img</code> element (e.g. XML
  files whose <span>document element</span> is an HTML element). User agents must not run executable
  code (e.g. scripts) embedded in the image resource. User agents must only display the first page
  of a multipage resource (e.g. a PDF file). User agents must not allow the resource to act in an
  interactive fashion, but should honour any animation in the resource.</p>

  <p>This specification does not specify which image types are to be supported.</p>
