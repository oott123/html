  <h6>When to obtain images</h6>

  <p>In a <span>browsing context</span> where <span data-x="concept-bc-noscript">scripting is
  disabled</span>, user agents may obtain images immediately or on demand. In a <span>browsing
  context</span> where <span data-x="concept-bc-noscript">scripting is enabled</span>, user agents
  must obtain images immediately.</p>

  <p>A user agent that obtains images immediately must synchronously
  <span>update the image data</span> of an <code>img</code> element,
  with the <i>restart animation</i> flag set if so stated,
  whenever that element is created or has experienced <span>relevant mutations</span>.</p>

  <p>A user agent that obtains images on demand must <span>update the image data</span> of an
  <code>img</code> element whenever it needs the image data (i.e. on demand),
  but only if the <code>img</code> element is in the
  <span data-x="img-none">unavailable</span> state. When an <code>img</code> element
  has experienced <span>relevant mutations</span>, if the user
  agent only obtains images on demand, the <code>img</code> element must return to the <span
  data-x="img-none">unavailable</span> state.</p>
