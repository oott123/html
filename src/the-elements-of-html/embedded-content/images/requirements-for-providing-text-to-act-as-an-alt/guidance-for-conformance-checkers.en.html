  <p>A conformance checker must report the lack of an <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute as an error unless one of the conditions listed below applies:</p>

  <ul>

   <!-- when editing this list, search for the two other occurrences of 'critical-no-alt' -->

   <li><p>The <code>img</code> element is in a <code>figure</code> element that satisfies <a
   href="#figcaption-as-alt-condition">the conditions described above</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code>img</code> element has a <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute with a
   value that is not the empty string (also as <a href="#unknown-images">described
   above</a>).</p></li>

   <!-- the following are additional entries not included in the aforementioned list, as they apply
   only to conformance checkers -->

   <li><p>The conformance checker has been configured to assume that the document is an e-mail or
   document intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code>img</code> element has a (non-conforming) <code
   data-x="attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code>
   attribute whose value is the empty string. A conformance checker that is not reporting the lack
   of an <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute as an error must also not report the
   presence of the empty <code
   data-x="attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code>
   attribute as an error. (This case does not represent a case where the document is conforming,
   only that the generator could not determine appropriate alternative text &mdash; validators are
   not required to show an error in this case, because such an error might encourage markup
   generators to include bogus alternative text purely in an attempt to silence validators.
   Naturally, conformance checkers <em>may</em> report the lack of an <code
   data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute as an error even in the presence of the <code
   data-x="attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code>
   attribute; for example, there could be a user option to report <em>all</em> conformance errors
   even those that might be the more or less inevitable result of using a markup
   generator.)</p></li>

  </ul>
