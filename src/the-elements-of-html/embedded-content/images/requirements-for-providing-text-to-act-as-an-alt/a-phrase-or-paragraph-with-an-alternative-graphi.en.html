<h6>A phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical representation: charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h6>

  <p>Sometimes something can be more clearly stated in graphical form, for example as a flowchart, a
  diagram, a graph, or a simple map showing directions. In such cases, an image can be given using
  the <code>img</code> element, but the lesser textual version must still be given, so that users
  who are unable to view the image (e.g. because they have a very slow connection, or because they
  are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to the page being read out by a
  hands-free automobile voice Web browser, or simply because they are blind) are still able to
  understand the message being conveyed.</p>

  <p>The text must be given in the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute, and must convey
  the same message as the image specified in the <code data-x="attr-img-src">src</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <p>It is important to realize that the alternative text is a <em>replacement</em> for the image,
  not a description of the image.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example we have <a href="images/parsing-model-overview.png">a flowchart</a>
   in image form, with text in the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute rephrasing the
   flowchart in prose form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage
comes from the network, but it can also come from script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="The Network
passes data to the Input Stream Preprocessor, which passes it to the
Tokenizer, which passes it to the Tree Construction stage. From there,
data goes to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is
linked to the DOM, and, using document.write(), passes data to the
Tokenizer."></strong>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here's another example, showing a good solution and a bad solution to the problem of including
   an image in a description.</p>

   <p>First, here's the good solution. This sample shows how the alternative text should just be
   what you would have put in the prose if the image had never existed.</p>

   <pre>&lt;!-- This is the correct way to do things. -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 <strong>&lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="The house is white, with a boarded front door."></strong>
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Second, here's the bad solution. In this incorrect way of doing things, the alternative text
   is simply a description of the image, instead of a textual replacement for the image. It's bad
   because when the image isn't shown, the text doesn't flow as well as in the first example.</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- <em>This is the wrong way to do things.</em> -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 &lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="A white house, with a boarded front door.">
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Text such as "Photo of white house with boarded door" would be equally bad alternative text
   (though it could be suitable for the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute or in the
   <code>figcaption</code> element of a <code>figure</code> with this image).</p>

  </div>
