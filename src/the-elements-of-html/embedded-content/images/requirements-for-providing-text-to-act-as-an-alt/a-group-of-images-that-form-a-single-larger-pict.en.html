<h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with no links</h6>

  <p>When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are then displayed together to
  form the complete picture again, one of the images must have its <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute set as per the relevant rules that would be appropriate
  for the picture as a whole, and then all the remaining images must have their <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute set to the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing a company logo for <span data-x="">XYZ
   Corp</span> has been split into two pieces, the first containing the letters "XYZ" and the second
   with the word "Corp". The alternative text ("XYZ Corp") is all in the first image.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="logo1.png" alt="XYZ Corp">&lt;img src="logo2.png" alt=""></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled stars and two empty stars. While
   the alternative text could have been "&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;", the author has
   instead decided to more helpfully give the rating in the form "3 out of 5". That is the
   alternative text of the first image, and the rest have blank alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Rating: &lt;meter max=5 value=3><strong>&lt;img src="1" alt="3 out of 5"
  >&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="0" alt=""
  >&lt;img src="0" alt=""></strong>&lt;/meter>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>
