<h6>A key part of the content</h6>

  <p>In some cases, the image is a critical part of the content. This could be the case, for
  instance, on a page that is part of a photo gallery. The image is the whole <em>point</em> of the
  page containing it.</p>

  <p>How to provide alternative text for an image that is a key part of the content depends on the
  image's provenance.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The general case</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When it is possible for detailed alternative text to be provided, for example if the image is
    part of a series of screenshots in a magazine review, or part of a comic strip, or is a
    photograph in a blog entry about that photograph, text that can serve as a substitute for the
    image must be given as the contents of the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A screenshot in a gallery of screenshots for a new OS, with some alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="KDE%20Light%20desktop.png"
      alt="The desktop is blue, with icons along the left hand side in
           two columns, reading System, Home, K-Mail, etc. A window is
           open showing that menus wrap to a second line if they
           cannot fit in the window. The window has a list of icons
           along the top, with an address bar below it, a list of
           icons for tabs along the left edge, a status bar on the
           bottom, and two panes in the middle. The desktop has a bar
           at the bottom of the screen with a few buttons, a pager, a
           list of open applications, and a clock."></strong>
 &lt;figcaption>Screenshot of a KDE desktop.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A graph in a financial report:</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="sales.gif"
     title="Sales graph"
     alt="From 1998 to 2005, sales increased by the following percentages
     with each year: 624%, 75%, 138%, 40%, 35%, 9%, 21%"></strong></pre>

     <p>Note that "sales graph" would be inadequate alternative text for a sales graph. Text that
     would be a good <em>caption</em> is not generally suitable as replacement text.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Images that defy a complete description</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In certain cases, the nature of the image might be such that providing thorough alternative
    text is impractical. For example, the image could be indistinct, or could be a complex fractal,
    or could be a detailed topographical map.</p>

    <p>In these cases, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must contain some
    suitable alternative text, but it may be somewhat brief.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes there simply is no text that can do justice to an image. For example, there is
     little that can be said to usefully describe a Rorschach inkblot test. However, a description,
     even if brief, is still better than nothing:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A shape with left-right
 symmetry with indistinct edges, with a small gap in the center, two
 larger gaps offset slightly from the center, with two similar gaps
 under them. The outline is wider in the top half than the bottom
 half, with the sides extending upwards higher than the center, and
 the center extending below the sides."></strong>
 &lt;figcaption>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Note that the following would be a very bad use of alternative text:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- This example is wrong. Do not copy it. -->
&lt;figure>
 &lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A black outline
 of the first of the ten cards in the Rorschach inkblot test.">
 &lt;figcaption>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Including the caption in the alternative text like this isn't useful because it effectively
     duplicates the caption for users who don't have images, taunting them twice yet not helping
     them any more than if they had only read or heard the caption once.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Another example of an image that defies full description is a fractal, which, by definition,
     is infinite in detail.</p>

     <p>The following example shows one possible way of providing alternative text for the full view
     of an image of the Mandelbrot set.</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="ms1.jpeg" alt="The Mandelbrot set appears as a cardioid with
its cusp on the real axis in the positive direction, with a smaller
bulb aligned along the same center line, touching it in the negative
direction, and with these two shapes being surrounded by smaller bulbs
of various sizes."></strong></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Similarly, a photograph of a person's face, for example in a biography, can be considered
     quite relevant and key to the content, but it can be hard to fully substitute text for:</p>

     <pre>&lt;section class="bio">
 &lt;h1>A Biography of Isaac Asimov&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>Born &lt;b>Isaak Yudovich Ozimov&lt;/b> in 1920, Isaac was a prolific author.&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;img src="headpics/asimov.jpeg" alt="Isaac Asimov had dark hair, a tall forehead, and wore glasses.
 Later in life, he wore long white sideburns.">
 &lt;p>Asimov was born in Russia, and moved to the US when he was three years old.&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>...
&lt;/section></pre>

     <p>In such cases it is unnecessary (and indeed discouraged) to include a reference to the
     presence of the image itself in the alternative text, since such text would be redundant with
     the browser itself reporting the presence of the image. For example, if the alternative text
     was "A photo of Isaac Asimov", then a conforming user agent might read that out as "(Image) A
     photo of Isaac Asimov" rather than the more useful "(Image) Isaac Asimov had dark hair, a tall
     forehead, and wore glasses...".</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt id="unknown-images">Images whose contents are not known</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In some unfortunate cases, there might be no alternative text available at all, either
    because the image is obtained in some automated fashion without any associated alternative text
    (e.g. a Webcam), or because the page is being generated by a script using user-provided images
    where the user did not provide suitable or usable alternative text (e.g. photograph sharing
    sites), or because the author does not themself know what the images represent (e.g. a blind
    photographer sharing an image on their blog).</p>

    <p>In such cases, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute may be omitted, but one of
    the following conditions must be met as well:</p>

    <ul>

     <!-- when editing this list, search for the two other occurrences of 'critical-no-alt' -->

     <!-- NOTE: the order of these steps is important; it's intended to encourage using <figcaption>
     rather than data-x="" -->

     <li id="figcaption-as-alt-condition"><p>The <code>img</code> element is in a
     <code>figure</code> element that contains a <code>figcaption</code> element that contains
     content other than <span>inter-element whitespace</span>, and, ignoring the
     <code>figcaption</code> element and its descendants, the <code>figure</code> element has no
     <span>flow content</span> descendants other than <span>inter-element whitespace</span> and the
     <code>img</code> element.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>The <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute is present and has a non-empty
      value.</p>

      <!-- search for title-warning if modifying this paragraph -->
      <p class="note">Relying on the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute is currently
      discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as
      required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a
      tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone
      with a modern phone or tablet).</p>

     </li>

    </ul>

    <p class="note">Such cases are to be kept to an absolute minimum. If there is even the slightest
    possibility of the author having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would not
    be acceptable to omit the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A photo on a photo-sharing site, if the site received the image with no metadata other than
     the caption, could be marked up as follows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="1100670787_6a7c664aef.jpg"></strong>
 &lt;figcaption>Bubbles traveled everywhere with us.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>It would be better, however, if a detailed description of the important parts of the image
     obtained from the user and included on the page.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A blind user's blog in which a photo taken by the user is shown. Initially, the user might
     not have any idea what the photo they took shows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg"></strong>
  &lt;figcaption>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/figcaption>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

     <p>Eventually though, the user might obtain a description of the image from their friends and
     could then include alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg" alt="The photograph shows my squirrel
  feeder hanging from the edge of my roof. It is half full, but there
  are no squirrels around. In the background, out-of-focus trees fill the
  shot. The feeder is made of wood with a metal grate, and it contains
  peanuts. The edge of the roof is wooden too, and is painted white
  with light blue streaks."></strong>
  &lt;figcaption>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/figcaption>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual description is not available, and
     the user is to provide the description. For instance, the point of a CAPTCHA image is to see if
     the user can literally read the graphic. Here is one way to mark up a CAPTCHA (note the <code
     data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute):</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>&lt;label>What does this image say?
<strong>&lt;img src="captcha.cgi?id=8934" title="CAPTCHA"></strong>
&lt;input type=text name=captcha>&lt;/label>
(If you cannot see the image, you can use an &lt;a
href="?audio">audio&lt;/a> test instead.)&lt;/p></pre>

     <p>Another example would be software that displays images and asks for alternative text
     precisely for the purpose of then writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page
     could have a table of images, like this:</p>

     <pre>&lt;table>
 &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr> &lt;th> Image &lt;th> Description
 &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2421.png" title="Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2421">
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2422.png" title="Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2422">
&lt;/table></pre>

     <p>Notice that even in this example, as much useful information as possible is still included
     in the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="note">Since some users cannot use images at all (e.g. because they have a very slow
    connection, or because they are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to the
    page being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web browser, or simply because they are
    blind), the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute is only allowed to be omitted rather
    than being provided with replacement text when no alternative text is available and none can be
    made available, as in the above examples. Lack of effort from the part of the author is not an
    acceptable reason for omitting the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>
