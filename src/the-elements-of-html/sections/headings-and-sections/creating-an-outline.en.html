<h5 id="outlines">Creating an outline</h5>

  <div w-nodev>

  <!-- v2 idea: It would be nice if there was a way to use this to autogenerate a table of contents
  or some such -->

  <p>This section defines an algorithm for creating an outline for a <span>sectioning content</span>
  element or a <span>sectioning root</span> element. It is defined in terms of a walk over the nodes
  of a DOM tree, in <span>tree order</span>, with each node being visited when it is <i>entered</i> and when it
  is <i>exited</i> during the walk.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <dfn>outline</dfn> for a <span>sectioning content</span> element or a <span>sectioning
  root</span> element consists of a list of one or more potentially nested <span
  data-x="concept-section">sections</span>. The element for which an <span>outline</span> is created
  is said to be <dfn>the outline's owner</dfn>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="concept-section">section</dfn> is a container that corresponds to some nodes in
  the original DOM tree. Each section can have one heading associated with it, and can contain any
  number of further nested sections. <span w-nodev>The algorithm for the outline also
  associates each node in the DOM tree with a particular section and potentially a heading.</span>
  (The sections in the outline aren't <code>section</code> elements, though some may correspond to
  such elements &mdash; they are merely conceptual sections.)</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following markup fragment:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
  &lt;hgroup id="document-title">
    &lt;h1>HTML&lt;/h1>
    &lt;h2>Living Standard — Last Updated 12 August 2016&lt;/h2>
  &lt;/hgroup>
  &lt;p>Some intro to the document.&lt;/p>
  &lt;h2>Table of contents&lt;/h2>
  &lt;ol id=toc>...&lt;/ol>
  &lt;h2>First section&lt;/h2>
  &lt;p>Some intro to the first section.&lt;/p>
&lt;/body></pre>

   <p>...results in the following outline being created for the <code>body</code> node (and thus the
   entire document):</p>

   <ol class="brief">
    <li>
     <p><strong>Section created for <code>body</code> node</strong>.</p>
     <p>Associated with heading <code data-x="">&lt;hgroup
     id="document-title">...&lt;/hgroup></code> consisting of primary heading <code
     data-x="">&lt;h1>HTML&lt;/h1></code> and secondary heading <code data-x="">&lt;h2>Living
     Standard — Last Updated 12 August 2016&lt;/h2></code>.</p>
     <p>Also associated with the paragraph <code data-x="">&lt;p>Some intro to the
     document.&lt;/p></code> (though it likely would not be shown in a rendered view of the
     outline).</p>
     <p>Nested sections:</p>
     <ol class="brief">
      <li>
       <p><strong>Section implied for first <code>h2</code> element.</strong></p>
       <p>Associated with heading <code data-x="">&lt;h2>Table of contents&lt;/h2></code>.</p>
       <p>Also associated with the ordered list <code data-x="">&lt;ol id=toc>...&lt;/ol></code>
       (though it likely would not be shown in a rendered view of the outline).</p>
       <p>No nested sections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p><strong>Section implied for second <code>h2</code> element.</strong></p>
       <p>Associated with heading <code data-x="">&lt;h2>First section&lt;/h2></code>.</p>
       <p>Also associated with the paragraph <code data-x="">&lt;p>Some intro to the first
       section.&lt;/p></code> (though it likely would not be shown in a rendered view of the
       outline).</p>
       <p>No nested sections.</p>
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>The following image shows what a rendered view of the outline might look like.</p>

  <p>The algorithm that must be followed during a walk of a DOM subtree rooted at a <span>sectioning
  content</span> element or a <span>sectioning root</span> element to determine that element's
  <span>outline</span> is as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>current outline target</var> be null. (It holds the element whose
   <span>outline</span> is being created.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>current section</var> be null. (It holds a pointer to a <span
   data-x="concept-section">section</span>, so that elements in the DOM can all be associated with a
   section.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Create a stack to hold elements, which is used to handle nesting. Initialize this stack to
   empty.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Walk over the DOM in <span>tree order</span>, starting with the <span>sectioning
    content</span> element or <span>sectioning root</span> element at the root of the subtree for
    which an outline is to be created, and trigger the first relevant step below for each element as
    the walk enters and exits it.</p>

  </ol>

  <p>The tree of sections created by the algorithm above, or a proper subset thereof, must be used
  when generating document outlines, for example when generating tables of contents.</p>

  <p>The outline created for <span>the body element</span> of a <code>Document</code> is the
  <span>outline</span> of the entire document.</p>

  <p>When creating an interactive table of contents, entries should jump the user to the relevant
  <span>sectioning content</span> element, if the <span data-x="concept-section">section</span> was
  created for a real element in the original document, or to the relevant <span>heading
  content</span> element, if the <span data-x="concept-section">section</span> in the tree was
  generated for a heading in the above process.</p>

  <p class="note">Selecting the first <span data-x="concept-section">section</span> of the document
  therefore always takes the user to the top of the document, regardless of where the first heading
  in the <code>body</code> is to be found.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>outline depth</dfn> of a <span>heading content</span> element associated with a <span
  data-x="concept-section">section</span> <var>section</var> is the number of <span
  data-x="concept-section">sections</span> that are ancestors of <var>section</var> in the
  outermost <span>outline</span> that <var>section</var> finds itself in when the <span
  data-x="outline">outlines</span> of its <code>Document</code>'s elements are created, plus 1. The
  <span>outline depth</span> of a <span>heading content</span> element not associated with a <span
  data-x="concept-section">section</span> is 1.</p>

  <p>User agents should provide default headings for sections that do not have explicit section
  headings.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider the following snippet:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;nav>
  &lt;p>&lt;a href="/">Home&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;/nav>
 &lt;p>Hello world.&lt;/p>
 &lt;aside>
  &lt;p>My cat is cute.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/aside>
&lt;/body></pre>

   <p>Although it contains no headings, this snippet has three sections: a document (the
   <code>body</code>) with two subsections (a <code>nav</code> and an <code>aside</code>). A user
   agent could present the outline as follows:</p>

   <ol class="brief">
    <li>Untitled document
     <ol>
      <li>Navigation</li>
      <li>Sidebar</li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>These default headings ("Untitled document", "Navigation", "Sidebar") are not specified by
   this specification, and might vary with the user's language, the page's language, the user's
   preferences, the user agent implementor's preferences, etc.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The following JavaScript function shows how the tree walk could be implemented. The <var>root</var> argument is the root of the tree to walk (either a <span>sectioning
   content</span> element or a <span>sectioning root</span> element), and the <var>enter</var> and <var>exit</var> arguments are callbacks that are called with
