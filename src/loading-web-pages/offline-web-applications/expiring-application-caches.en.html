  <h4>Expiring application caches</h4>

  <p>As a general rule, user agents should not expire application caches, except on request from the
  user, or after having been left unused for an extended period of time.</p>

  <p>Application caches and cookies have similar implications with respect to privacy (e.g. if the
  site can identify the user when providing the cache, it can store data in the cache that can be
  used for cookie resurrection). Implementors are therefore encouraged to expose application caches
  in a manner related to HTTP cookies, allowing caches to be expunged together with cookies and
  other origin-specific data.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a user agent could have a "delete site-specific data" feature that
  clears all cookies, application caches, local storage, databases, etc, from an origin all at
  once.</p>
