  <!--FETCH--><p class="&#x0058;&#x0058;&#x0058;">If "AppCache" is not removed as a feature this
  section needs to be integrated into the Fetch standard.</p>

  <p>When a <span>cache host</span> is associated with an <span>application cache</span> whose <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness flag</span> is <i>complete</i>, any and all
  loads for resources related to that <span>cache host</span> other than those for <span
  data-x="child browsing context">child browsing contexts</span> must go through the following steps
  instead of immediately invoking the mechanisms appropriate to that resource's scheme:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the resource is not to be fetched using the GET method, or if applying the <span>URL
   parser</span> algorithm to both its <span>URL</span> and the <span>application cache</span>'s
   <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>'s URL results in two <span data-x="URL
   record">URL records</span> with different <span data-x="concept-url-scheme">scheme</span>
   components, then fetch the resource normally and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the resource's URL is <span data-x="concept-appcache-master">a master entry</span>,
   <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">the manifest</span>, <span
   data-x="concept-appcache-explicit">an explicit entry</span>, or <span
   data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">a fallback entry</span> in the <span>application cache</span>,
   then get the resource from the cache (instead of fetching it), and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is an entry in the <span>application cache</span>'s <span
   data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online safelist</span> that has the <span>same
   origin</span> as the resource's URL and that is a <span>prefix match</span> for the resource's
   URL, then fetch the resource normally and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the resource's URL has the <span>same origin</span> as the manifest's URL, and there is a
    <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span> <var>f</var> in
    the <span>application cache</span> that is a <span>prefix match</span> for the resource's URL,
    then:</p>

    <p>Fetch the resource normally. If this results in a redirect to a resource with another
    <span>origin</span> (indicative of a captive portal), or a 4xx or 5xx status code, or if there
    were network errors (but not if the user canceled the download), then instead get, from the
    cache, the resource of the <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entry</span>
    corresponding to the <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span>
    <var>f</var>. Abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the <span>application cache</span>'s <span
   data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard">online safelist wildcard flag</span> is
   <i>open</i>, then fetch the resource normally and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Fail the resource load as if there had been a generic network error.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">The above algorithm ensures that so long as the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard">online safelist wildcard flag</span> is
  <i>blocking</i>, resources that are not present in the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> will always fail to load (at least, after the
  <span>application cache</span> has been primed the first time), making the testing of offline
  applications simpler.</p>
