<h4>Security concerns with offline applications caches</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>The main risk introduced by offline application caches is that an injection attack can be
  elevated into persistent site-wide page replacement. This attack involves using an injection
  vulnerability to upload two files to the victim site. The first file is an application cache
  manifest consisting of just a fallback entry pointing to the second file, which is an HTML page
  whose manifest is declared as that first file. Once the user has been directed to that second
  file, all subsequent accesses to any file covered by the given fallback namespace while either the
  user or the site is offline will instead show that second file. Targeted denial-of-service
  attacks or cookie bombing attacks (where the client is made to send so many cookies that the
  server refuses to process the request) can be used to ensure that the site appears offline.</p>

  <p>To mitigate this, manifests can only specify fallbacks that are in the same path as the
  manifest itself. This means that a content injection upload vulnerability in a particular
  directory on a server can only be escalated to a take-over of that directory and its
  subdirectories. If there is no way to inject a file into the root directory, the entire site
  cannot be taken over.</p>

  <p>If a site has been attacked in this way, simply removing the offending manifest might eventually
  clear the problem, since the next time the manifest is updated, a 404 error will be seen, and the
  user agent will clear the cache. "Eventually" is the key word here, however; while the attack on
  the user or server is ongoing, such that connections from an affected user to the affected site
  are blocked, the user agent will simply assume that the user is offline and will continue to use
  the hostile manifest. Unfortunately, if a cookie bombing attack has also been used, merely
  removing the manifest is insufficient; in addition, the server has to be configured to return a
  404 or 410 response instead of the 413 "Request Entity Too Large" response.</p>

  <p>TLS does not inherently protect a site from this attack, since the attack relies on content
  being served from the server itself. Not using application caches also does not prevent this
  attack, since the attack relies on an attacker-provided manifest.</p>
