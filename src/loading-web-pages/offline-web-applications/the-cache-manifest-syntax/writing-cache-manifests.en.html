<h5>Writing cache manifests</h5>

  <p>Manifests must be served using the <code>text/cache-manifest</code> <span>MIME type</span>. All
  resources served using the <code>text/cache-manifest</code> <span>MIME type</span> must follow the
  syntax of application cache manifests, as described in this section.</p>

  <p>An application cache manifest is a text file, whose text is encoded using UTF-8. Data in
  application cache manifests is line-based. Newlines must be represented by U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  characters, U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) U+000A LINE
  FEED (LF) pairs. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p class="note">This is a <span>willful violation</span> of RFC 2046, which requires all <code
  data-x="">text/*</code> types to only allow CRLF line breaks. This requirement, however, is
  outdated; the use of CR, LF, and CRLF line breaks is commonly supported and indeed sometimes CRLF
  is <em>not</em> supported by text editors. <ref spec=RFC2046></p>

  <p>The first line of an application cache manifest must consist of the string "CACHE", a single
  U+0020 SPACE character, the string "MANIFEST", and either a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009
  CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, or a U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN (CR) character. The first line may optionally be preceded by a U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM)
  character. If any other text is found on the first line, it is ignored.</p>

  <p>Subsequent lines, if any, must all be one of the following:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>A blank line
   <dd>
    <p>Blank lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and
    U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters only.</p>

   <dt>A comment
   <dd>
    <p>Comment lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
    characters, followed by a single U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), followed by zero or more
    characters other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters.</p>

    <p class="note">Comments must be on a line on their own. If they were to be included on a line
    with a URL, the "#" would be mistaken for part of a <span
    data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span>.</p>

   <dt>A section header
   <dd>

    <p>Section headers change the current section. There are four possible section headers:

    <dl>

     <dt><code data-x="">CACHE:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-explicit">explicit section</dfn>.

     <dt><code data-x="">FALLBACK:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-fallback">fallback section</dfn>.

     <dt><code data-x="">NETWORK:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-network">online safelist section</dfn>.

     <dt><code data-x="">SETTINGS:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-settings">settings section</dfn>.

    </dl>

    <p>Section header lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters, followed by one of the names above (including the U+003A COLON
    character (:)) followed by zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
    characters.</p>

    <p>Ironically, by default, the current section is the <span
    data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-explicit">explicit section</span>.</p>

   <dt>Data for the current section
   <dd>

    <p>The format that data lines must take depends on the current section.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-explicit">explicit
    section</span>, data lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters, a <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource other than the
    manifest itself, and then zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
    characters.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-fallback">fallback
    section</span>, data lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters, a <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource other than the
    manifest itself, one or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters,
    another <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource other than the manifest itself, and then
    zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-network">online
    safelist section</span>, data lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009
    CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters, either a single U+002A ASTERISK character (*) <!--
    concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard --> or a <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource
    other than the manifest itself, and then zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-settings">settings
    section</span>, data lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters, a <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-setting">setting</span>,
    and then zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p>Currently only one <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-setting">setting</dfn> is
    defined:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>The cache mode setting</dt>

     <dd>This consists of the string "<code data-x="">prefer-online</code>". It sets the <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-mode">cache mode</span> to <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-mode-prefer-online">prefer-online</span>. (The <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-mode">cache mode</span> defaults to <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-mode-fast">fast</span>.)</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>Within a <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-settings">settings section</span>, each <span
    data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-setting">setting</span> must occur no more than once.</p>

<!--
    <p class="note">The URLs in data lines can't be empty strings, since those would be relative
    URLs to the manifest itself. Such lines would be confused with blank or invalid lines,
    anyway.</p>
-->

  </dl>

  <p>Manifests may contain sections more than once. Sections may be empty.</p>

  <p>URLs that are to be fallback pages associated with <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespaces</span>, and those namespaces themselves,
  must be given in <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-fallback">fallback sections</span>, with
  the namespace being the first URL of the data line, and the corresponding fallback page being the
  second URL. All the other pages to be cached must be listed in <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-explicit">explicit sections</span>.</p>

  <p><span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">Fallback namespaces</span> and <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entries</span> must have the <span>same origin</span>
  as the manifest itself. <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">Fallback namespaces</span>
  must also be in the same path as the manifest's URL.</p>

  <p>A <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span> must not be listed more
  than once.</p>

  <p>Namespaces that the user agent is to put into the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online safelist</span> must all be specified in <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-network">online safelist sections</span>. (This is needed for
  any URL that the page is intending to use to communicate back to the server.) To specify that all
  URLs are automatically safelisted in this way, a U+002A ASTERISK character (*) may be specified
  as one of the URLs. <!-- concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard --></p>

  <p>Authors should not include namespaces in the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online safelist</span> for which another namespace in
  the <span data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online safelist</span> is a <span>prefix
  match</span>.</p>

  <p><span data-x="relative URL">Relative URLs</span> must be given relative to the manifest's own
  URL. All URLs in the manifest must have the same <span data-x="concept-url-scheme">scheme</span> as
  the manifest itself (either explicitly or implicitly, through the use of <span data-x="relative
  URL">relative URLs</span>). <ref spec=URL></p>

  <p>URLs in manifests must not have <span data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragments</span> (i.e. the
  U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character isn't allowed in URLs in manifests).</p>

  <p><span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">Fallback namespaces</span> and namespaces in the
  <span data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online safelist</span> are matched by <span>prefix
  match</span>.</p>
