  <h5>Some sample manifests</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <div class="example">

   <p>This example manifest requires two images and a style sheet to be cached and safelists a CGI
   script.</p>

   <pre>CACHE MANIFEST
# the above line is required

# this is a comment
# there can be as many of these anywhere in the file
# they are all ignored
  # comments can have spaces before them
  # but must be alone on the line

# blank lines are ignored too

# these are files that need to be cached they can either be listed
# first, or a "CACHE:" header could be put before them, as is done
# lower down.
images/sound-icon.png
images/background.png
# note that each file has to be put on its own line

# here is a file for the online safelist -- it isn't cached, and
# references to this file will bypass the cache, always hitting the
# network (or trying to, if the user is offline).
NETWORK:
comm.cgi

# here is another set of files to cache, this time just the CSS file.
CACHE:
style/default.css</pre>

   <p>It could equally well be written as follows:</p>

   <pre>CACHE MANIFEST
NETWORK:
comm.cgi
CACHE:
style/default.css
images/sound-icon.png
images/background.png</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Offline application cache manifests can use absolute paths or even absolute URLs:</p>

   <pre>CACHE MANIFEST

/main/home
/main/app.js
/settings/home
/settings/app.js
https://img.example.com/logo.png
https://img.example.com/check.png
https://img.example.com/cross.png</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following manifest defines a catch-all error page that is displayed for any page on the
   site while the user is offline. It also specifies that the <span
   data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard">online safelist wildcard flag</span> is <i>open</i>, meaning that accesses to resources on other sites will not be blocked.
   (Resources on the same site are already not blocked because of the catch-all fallback
   namespace.)</p>

   <p>So long as all pages on the site reference this manifest, they will get cached locally as they
   are fetched, so that subsequent hits to the same page will load the page immediately from the
   cache. Until the manifest is changed, those pages will not be fetched from the server again. When
   the manifest changes, then all the files will be redownloaded.</p>

   <p>Subresources, such as style sheets, images, etc, would only be cached using the regular HTTP
   caching semantics, however.</p>
