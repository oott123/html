  <h4>The session history of browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>The sequence of <code>Document</code>s in a <span>browsing context</span> is its <dfn>session
  history</dfn>. Each <span>browsing context</span>, including <span data-x="nested browsing
  context">nested browsing contexts</span>, has a distinct session history. A <span>browsing
  context</span>'s session history consists of a flat list of <span data-x="session history
  entry">session history entries</span>. Each <dfn>session history entry</dfn> consists, at a
  minimum, of a <span>URL</span>, and each entry may in addition have a <span>state object</span>, a
  title, a <code>Document</code> object, form data, a <span>scroll restoration mode</span>, a scroll
  position, a <span>browsing context name</span>, and other information associated with it.</p>

  <p class="note">Each entry, when first created, has a <code>Document</code>. However, when a
  <code>Document</code> is not <span data-x="fully active">active</span>, it's possible for it to be
  <span data-x="discard a Document">discarded</span> to free resources. The <span>URL</span> and
  other data in a <span>session history entry</span> is then used to bring a new
  <code>Document</code> into being to take the place of the original, should the user agent find
  itself having to reactivate that <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">Titles associated with <span data-x="session history entry">session history
  entries</span> need not have any relation with the current <code>title</code> of the
  <code>Document</code>. The title of a <span>session history entry</span> is intended to explain
  the state of the document at that point, so that the user can navigate the document's history.</p>

  <p>URLs without associated <span data-x="state object">state objects</span> are added to the
  session history as the user (or script) navigates from page to page.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> object in a <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session
  history</span> is associated with a unique <code>History</code> object which must all model the
  same underlying <span>session history</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-history">history</code></dfn> attribute of the <code>Window</code>
  interface must return the object implementing the <code>History</code> interface for this
  <code>Window</code> object's <span data-x="concept-document-window">associated
  <code>Document</code></span>.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>A <dfn>state object</dfn> is an object representing a user interface state.</p>

  <p>Pages can <span data-x="dom-history-pushState">add</span> <span data-x="state object">state
  objects</span> to the session history. These are then <span data-x="event-popstate">returned to the
  script</span> when the user (or script) goes back in the history, thus enabling authors to use the
  "navigation" metaphor even in one-page applications.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p><span data-x="state object">State objects</span> are intended to be used for two main purposes:
   first, storing a preparsed description of the state in the <span>URL</span> so that in the simple
   case an author doesn't have to do the parsing (though one would still need the parsing for
   handling <span data-x="URL">URLs</span> passed around by users, so it's only a minor
   optimization), and second, so that the author can store state that one wouldn't store in the URL
   because it only applies to the current <code>Document</code> instance and it would have to be
   reconstructed if a new <code>Document</code> were opened.</p>

   <p>An example of the latter would be something like keeping track of the precise coordinate from
   which a pop-up <code>div</code> was made to animate, so that if the user goes back, it can be
   made to animate to the same location. Or alternatively, it could be used to keep a pointer into a
   cache of data that would be fetched from the server based on the information in the
   <span>URL</span>, so that when going back and forward, the information doesn't have to be fetched
   again.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>At any point, one of the entries in the session history is the <dfn>current entry</dfn>. This
  is the entry representing the <span>active document</span> of the <span>browsing context</span>.
  Which entry is the <span>current entry</span> is changed by the algorithms defined in this
  specification, e.g. during <span data-x="traverse the history">session history
  traversal</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>current entry</span> is usually an entry for the <span
  data-x="concept-document-url">URL</span> of the <code>Document</code>. However, it can also be one
  of the entries for <span data-x="state object">state objects</span> added to the history by that
  document.</p>

  <p><dfn>An entry with persisted user state</dfn> is one that also has user-agent defined state.
  This specification does not specify what kind of state can be stored.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, some user agents might want to persist the scroll position, or the
  values of form controls.</p>

  <p class="note">User agents that persist the value of form controls are encouraged to also persist
  their directionality (the value of the element's <code data-x="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute).
  This prevents values from being displayed incorrectly after a history traversal when the user had
  originally entered the values with an explicit, non-default directionality.</p>

  <p>An entry's <dfn>scroll restoration mode</dfn> indicates whether the user agent should
  restore the persisted scroll position (if any) when traversing to it. The scroll restoration
  mode may be one of the following:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>"<dfn><code subdfn data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-auto">auto</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd>The user agent is responsible for restoring the scroll position upon navigation.</dd>
   <dt>"<dfn><code subdfn data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-manual">manual</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd>The page is responsible for restoring the scroll position and the user agent does not
   attempt to do so automatically</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If unspecified, the <span>scroll restoration mode</span> of a new entry must be set to
  "<code data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-auto">auto</code>".</p>

  <p>Entries that consist of <span data-x="state object">state objects</span> share the same
  <code>Document</code> as the entry for the page that was active when they were added.</p>

  <p>Contiguous entries that differ just by their <span data-x="URL">URLs</span>' <span
  data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragments</span> also share the same <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">All entries that share the same <code>Document</code> (and that are therefore
  merely different states of one particular document) are contiguous by definition.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> in a <span>browsing context</span> can also have a <dfn>latest
  entry</dfn>. This is the entry for that <code>Document</code> to which the <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span>session history</span> was most recently traversed. When a
  <code>Document</code> is created, it initially has no <span>latest entry</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>User agents may <span data-x="discard a Document">discard</span> the <code>Document</code>
  objects of entries other than the <span>current entry</span> that are not referenced from any
  script, reloading the pages afresh when the user or script navigates back to such pages. This
  specification does not specify when user agents should discard <code>Document</code> objects and
  when they should cache them.</p>

  <p>Entries that have had their <code>Document</code> objects discarded must, for the purposes of
  the algorithms given below, act as if they had not. When the user or script navigates back or
  forwards to a page which has no in-memory DOM objects, any other entries that shared the same
  <code>Document</code> object with it must share the new object as well.</p>

  </div>
