  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>The <code>History</code> interface is not meant to place restrictions on how implementations
  represent the session history to the user.</p>

  <p>For example, session history could be implemented in a tree-like manner, with each page having
  multiple "forward" pages. This specification doesn't define how the linear list of pages in the
  <code data-x="dom-history">history</code> object are derived from the actual session history as
  seen from the user's perspective.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a page containing two <code>iframe</code>s has a <code
  data-x="dom-history">history</code> object distinct from the <code>iframe</code>s' <code
  data-x="dom-history">history</code> objects, despite the fact that typical Web browsers present the
  user with just one "Back" button, with a session history that interleaves the navigation of the
  two inner frames and the outer page.</p>

<!--ADD-TOPIC:Security-->
  <p><strong>Security</strong>: It is suggested that to avoid letting a page "hijack" the history
  navigation facilities of a UA by abusing <code data-x="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code>,
  the UA provide the user with a way to jump back to the previous page (rather than just going back
  to the previous state). For example, the back button could have a drop down showing just the pages
  in the session history, and not showing any of the states. Similarly, an aural browser could have
  two "back" commands, one that goes back to the previous state, and one that jumps straight back to
  the previous page.</p>

  <p>For both <code data-x="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code> and <code
  data-x="dom-history-replaceState">replaceState()</code>, user agents are encouraged to prevent
  abuse of these APIs via too-frequent calls or over-large state objects. As detailed above, the
  algorithm explicitly allows user agents to ignore any such calls when appropriate.</p>
