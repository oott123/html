<h5>Persisted user state restoration</h5>
  <div w-nodev>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>restore persisted user state</dfn> from a history entry, it must
  run the following steps immediately:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the entry has a <span>scroll restoration mode</span>, let <var>scrollRestoration</var>
   be that. Otherwise let <var>scrollRestoration</var> be "<code
   data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-auto">auto</code>"</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>scrollRestoration</var> is "<code
   data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-manual">manual</code>" the user agent should not restore the scroll
   position for the <code>Document</code> or any of its scrollable regions, with the exception of
   any nested browsing contexts whose scroll restoration is controlled by their own history entry's
   <span>scroll restoration mode</span>, otherwise, it may do so.</p></li>

   <li><p>Optionally, update other aspects of the document and its rendering, for instance values of
   form fields, that the user agent had previously recorded.</p></li>

  </ol>
  </div>

  <!-- see similar paragraphs in the textarea and input sections -->
  <p class="note">This can even include updating the <code data-x="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute
  of <code>textarea</code> elements or <code>input</code> elements whose <code
  data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in either the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-text">Text</span> state or the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-search">Search</span> state, if the persisted state includes the
  directionality of user input in such controls.</p>

  <p class="note">Not restoring the scroll position by user agent does not imply that the scroll
  position will be left at any particular value (e.g., (0,0)). The actual scroll position depends on
  the navigation type and the user agent's particular caching strategy. So web applications should
  not assume any particular scroll position but rather should set it to what they want it to be.</p>
