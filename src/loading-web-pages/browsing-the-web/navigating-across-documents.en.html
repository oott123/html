  <h4>Navigating across documents</h4>

  <p>Certain actions cause the <span>browsing context</span> to <i data-x="navigate">navigate</i> to
  a new resource. A user agent may provide various ways for the user to explicitly cause a browsing
  context to navigate, in addition to those defined in this specification.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, <span data-x="following hyperlinks">following a hyperlink</span>,
  <span data-x="concept-form-submit">form submission</span>, and the <code
  data-x="dom-open">window.open()</code> and <code
  data-x="dom-location-assign">location.assign()</code> methods can all cause a browsing context to
  navigate.</p>

  <p class="note">A <i>resource</i> has a URL, but that might not be the only information necessary
  to identify it. For example, a form submission that uses HTTP POST would also have the HTTP method
  and payload. Similarly, <span>an <code>iframe</code> <code
  data-x="attr-iframe-srcdoc">srcdoc</code> document</span> needs to know the data it is to use.</p>

  <p>Navigation always involves <dfn data-export="">source browsing context</dfn>, which is the
  browsing context which was responsible for starting the navigation.</p>

  <!-- NAVIGATE <dfn>navigate</dfn> -->
  <!-- For places that _call_ this, as opposed to just referring to
  it, search for "DONAV" -->
  <p>To <dfn data-export="">navigate</dfn> a browsing context <var>browsingContext</var> to a
  resource <var>resource</var>, optionally with an <dfn id="exceptions-enabled"
  data-export=""><var>exceptions enabled flag</var></dfn>, the user agent must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>resource</var> is a <span>URL</span>, then set <var>resource</var> to a new <span
   data-x="concept-request">request</span> whose <span data-x="concept-request-url">url</span> is
   <var>resource</var>.</p></li>

   <li id="sandboxLinks">
    <p>If the <span>source browsing context</span> is not <span>allowed to navigate</span>
    <var>browsingContext</var>, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>If the <var><span>exceptions enabled flag</span></var> is set, then throw a
     <span>"<code>SecurityError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>.</p></li>

     <li>
      <p>Otherwise, the user agent may instead offer to open <var>resource</var> in a new
      <span>top-level browsing context</span> or in the <span>top-level browsing context</span> of
      the <span>source browsing context</span>, at the user's option, in which case the user agent
      must <span>navigate</span><!--DONAV sandbox manual load--> that designated <span>top-level
      browsing context</span> to <var>resource</var> as if the user had requested it
      independently.</p>

      <p class="note">Doing so, however, can be dangerous, as it means that the user is overriding
      the author's explicit request to sandbox the content.</p>
     </li>
