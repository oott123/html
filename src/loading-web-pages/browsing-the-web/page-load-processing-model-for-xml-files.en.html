  <h4 id="read-xml"><dfn data-x="navigate-xml">Page load processing model for XML files</dfn></h4>

  <p>When faced with displaying an XML file inline, user agents must follow the requirements defined
  in the XML and Namespaces in XML recommendations, RFC 7303, DOM, and other relevant specifications
  to create a <code>Document</code> object and a corresponding <span>XML parser</span>. <ref spec=XML> <ref spec=XMLNS> <ref spec=RFC7303> <ref spec=DOM></p>

  <p class="note">At the time of writing, the XML specification community had not actually yet
  specified how XML and the DOM interact.</p> <!--XMLPARSE-->

  <p>After the <code>Document</code> is created, the user agent must <span>initialize the
  <code>Document</code> object</span>.</p>

  <p>The actual HTTP headers and other metadata, not the headers as mutated or implied by the
  algorithms given in this specification, are the ones that must be used when determining the
  character encoding according to the rules given in the above specifications. Once the character
  encoding is established, the <span>document's character encoding</span> must be set to that
  character encoding.</p>

  <p>If the <span>document element</span>, as parsed according to the XML specifications cited
  above, is found to be an <code>html</code> element with an attribute <code
  data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> whose value is not the empty string, then, as soon as
  the element is <span data-x="node is inserted into a document">inserted into the document</span>,
  the user agent must <span data-x="parse a url">parse</span> the value of that attribute relative
  to that element's <span>node document</span>, and if that is successful, must apply the <span
  data-x="concept-url-serializer">URL serializer</span> algorithm to the <span>resulting URL
  record</span> with the <i>exclude fragment flag</i> set to obtain <var>manifest URL</var>, and
  then run the <span data-x="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection algorithm</span>
  with <var>manifest URL</var> as the manifest URL, passing in the newly-created
  <code>Document</code>. Otherwise, if the attribute is absent, its value is the empty string, or
  parsing its value fails, then as soon as the <span>document element</span> is <span data-x="node
  is inserted into a document">inserted into the document</span>, the user agent must run the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection algorithm</span> with no manifest, and
  passing in the <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">Because the processing of the <code data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code>
  attribute happens only once the <span>document element</span> is parsed, any URLs referenced by
  processing instructions before the <span>document element</span> (such as <code
  data-x="">&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> PIs) will be fetched from the network and cannot be
  cached.</p><!-- v2: fix this somehow -->

  <p>User agents may examine the namespace of the root <code>Element</code> node of this
  <code>Document</code> object to perform namespace-based dispatch to alternative processing tools,
  e.g. determining that the content is actually a syndication feed and passing it to a feed handler.
  If such processing is to take place, abort the steps in this section, and jump to <a
  href="#navigate-non-Document">the next step</a> (labeled <i>non-document content</i>) in the
  <span>navigate</span> steps above.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, then, with the newly created <code>Document</code>, the user agent must <span>update
  the session history with the new page</span>. User agents may do this before the complete document
  has been parsed (thus achieving <i>incremental rendering</i>), and must do this before any scripts
  are to be executed.</p>

  <p>Error messages from the parse process (e.g. XML namespace well-formedness errors) may be
  reported inline by mutating the <code>Document</code>.</p>
