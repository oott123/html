  <h4 id="read-text"><dfn data-x="navigate-text">Page load processing model for text files</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a plain text document is to be loaded in a <span>browsing context</span>, the user agent
  must <span>queue a task</span> to create a <code>Document</code> object, mark it as being an <span
  data-x="HTML documents">HTML document</span>, set its <span
  data-x="concept-document-content-type">content type</span> to the <span
  data-x="Content-Type sniffing">computed MIME type</span> of the resource (<var>type</var> in the
  <span>navigate</span> algorithm), <span>initialize the <code>Document</code> object</span>,
  create an <span>HTML parser</span>, associate it with the <code>Document</code>, act as if the
  tokenizer had emitted a start tag token with the tag name "pre" followed by a single U+000A LINE
  FEED (LF) character<!-- to get eaten, so that a leading LF in the text/plain stream doesn't get
  eaten itself-->, and switch the <span>HTML parser</span>'s tokenizer to the <span>PLAINTEXT
  state</span>. Each <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that the <span>networking task
  source</span> places on the <span>task queue</span> while fetching runs must then fill the
  parser's <span>input byte stream</span> with the fetched bytes and cause the <span>HTML
  parser</span> to perform the appropriate processing of the input stream.</p>

  <p>The rules for how to convert the bytes of the plain text document into actual characters, and
  the rules for actually rendering the text to the user, are defined by the specifications for the
  <span data-x="Content-Type sniffing">computed MIME type</span> of the resource (<var>type</var>
  in the <span>navigate</span> algorithm).</p>

  <p>The <span>document's character encoding</span> must be set to the character encoding used to
  decode the document.</p>

  <p>Upon creation of the <code>Document</code> object, the user agent must run the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection algorithm</span> with no manifest, and
  passing in the newly-created <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <!-- next two paragraphs are nearly identical to the navigate-html section and similar to the
  "navigate-ua-inline" section, and the next three are similar to the navigate-media and
  navigate-plugin sections; keep them all in sync -->

  <p>When no more bytes are available, the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> for the parser
  to process the implied EOF character, which eventually causes a <code
  data-x="event-load">load</code> event to be fired.</p>

  <p>After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially before the page has finished
  parsing, the user agent must <span>update the session history with the new page</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents may add content to the <code>head</code> element of the <code>Document</code>,
  e.g., linking to a style sheet, providing script, or giving the document a <code>title</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">In particular, if the user agent supports the <code data-x="">Format=Flowed</code>
  feature of RFC 3676 then the user agent would need to apply extra styling to cause the text to
  wrap correctly and to handle the quoting feature. This could be performed using, e.g., a CSS
  extension.</p>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for the two tasks mentioned in this section must be the
  <span>networking task source</span>.</p>
