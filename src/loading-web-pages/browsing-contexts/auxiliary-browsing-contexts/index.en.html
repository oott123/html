  <h4>Auxiliary browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>It is possible to create new browsing contexts that are related to a <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> without being nested through an element. Such browsing contexts are called <dfn
  data-x="auxiliary browsing context" data-lt="auxiliary browsing context" data-export="">auxiliary
  browsing contexts</dfn>. Auxiliary browsing contexts are always <span data-x="top-level browsing
  context" data-lt="top-level browsing context" data-export="">top-level browsing
  contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>An <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> has an <dfn data-export="">opener browsing
  context</dfn>, which is the <span>browsing context</span> from which the <span>auxiliary browsing
  context</span> was created.</p>
