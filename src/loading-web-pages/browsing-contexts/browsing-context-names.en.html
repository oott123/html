<h4>Browsing context names</h4>

  <p>Browsing contexts can have a <dfn>browsing context name</dfn>. Unless stated otherwise, it is
  the empty string.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name</dfn> is any string with at least one character that does
  not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for
  special keywords.)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name or keyword</dfn> is any string that is either a <span>valid
  browsing context name</span> or that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of:
  <code data-x="">_blank</code>, <code data-x="">_self</code>, <code data-x="">_parent</code>, or
  <code data-x="">_top</code>.</p>

  <p>These values have different meanings based on whether the page is sandboxed or not, as
  summarized in the following (non-normative) table. In this table, "current" means the
  <span>browsing context</span> that the link or script is in, "parent" means the <span>parent
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "top" means the <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "new" means a new <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> or <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> is to be created, subject to
  various user preferences and user agent policies, "none" means that nothing will happen, and
  "maybe new" means the same as "new" if the "<code
  data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-popups">allow-popups</code>" keyword is also specified on the
  <code data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox">sandbox</code> attribute (or if the user overrode the
  sandboxing), and the same as "none" otherwise.</p>

  <p class="tablenote"><small>Most of the restrictions on sandboxed browsing contexts are applied by
  other algorithms, e.g. the <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span> algorithm, not <span>the rules
  for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name</span> given below.</small></p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>The rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name</dfn> are as
  follows. The rules assume that they are being applied in the context of a <span>browsing
  context</span>, as part of the execution of a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the given browsing context name is the empty string or <code data-x="">_self</code>, then
    the chosen browsing context must be the current one.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the given browsing context name is <code data-x="">_parent</code>, then the chosen
   browsing context must be the <span><em>parent</em> browsing context</span> of the current one,
   unless there isn't one, in which case the chosen browsing context must be the current browsing
   context.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the given browsing context name is <code data-x="">_top</code>, then the chosen browsing
   context must be the <span>top-level browsing context</span> of the current one, if there is one,
   or else the current browsing context.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the given browsing context name is not <code data-x="">_blank</code> and there exists a
    browsing context whose <span data-x="browsing context name">name</span> is the same as the given
    browsing context name, and the current browsing context is <span>familiar with</span> that
    browsing context, and the user agent determines that the two browsing contexts are related
    enough that it is ok if they reach each other, then that browsing context must be the chosen
    one. If there are multiple matching browsing contexts, the user agent should select one in some
    arbitrary consistent manner, such as the most recently opened, most recently focused, or more
    closely related.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, a new browsing context is being requested, and what happens depends on the user
    agent's configuration and abilities &mdash; it is determined by the rules given for the first
    applicable option from the following list:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt id="popup-blocker">If the algorithm is not <span>triggered by user activation</span> and
     the user agent has been configured to not show popups (i.e. the user agent has a "popup
     blocker" enabled)</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>There is no chosen browsing context. The user agent may inform the user that a popup has
      been blocked.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt id="sandboxWindowOpen">If the current browsing context's <span>active document</span>'s
     <span>active sandboxing flag set</span> has the <span>sandboxed auxiliary navigation browsing
     context flag</span> set.</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Typically, there is no chosen browsing context.</p>

      <p>The user agent may offer to <span data-x="creating a new browsing context">create</span> a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> or reuse
      an existing <span>top-level browsing context</span>. If the user picks one of those options,
      then the designated browsing context must be the chosen one (the browsing context's name isn't
      set to the given browsing context name). The default behavior (if the user agent doesn't
      offer the option to the user, or if the user declines to allow a browsing context to be used)
      must be that there must not be a chosen browsing context.</p>

      <p class="warning">If this case occurs, it means that an author has explicitly sandboxed the
      document that is trying to open a link.</p>

     </dd>


     <dt id="noopener">If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will
     create a new browsing context:</dt>

     <dd>
      <p>A new <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> must be created, with the <span>opener
      browsing context</span> being the current one. If the given browsing context name is not
      <code data-x="">_blank</code>, then the new auxiliary browsing context's name must be the
      given browsing context name (otherwise, it has no name). The chosen browsing context must be
      this new browsing context.</p>

      <p class="note">If the newly created <span>browsing context</span> is immediately <span
      data-x="navigate">navigated</span>, then the navigation will be done with <span>replacement
      enabled</span>.</p>
     </dd>

     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will reuse the current
     browsing context</dt>

     <dd><p>The chosen browsing context is the current browsing context.</p></dd>


     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will not find a
     browsing context</dt>

     <dd><p>There must not be a chosen browsing context.</p></dd>

    </dl>

    <p>User agent implementors are encouraged to provide a way for users to configure the user agent
    to always reuse the current browsing context.</p>

    <p>If the chosen browsing context picked above, if any, is a new browsing context, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>flagSet</var> be the current browsing context's <span>active document</span>'s
     <span>active sandboxing flag set</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <span>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</span> is set,
     then the current browsing context must be set as the new browsing context's <span>one permitted
     sandboxed navigator</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <span>sandbox propagates to auxiliary browsing contexts
     flag</span> is set, then all the flags that are set in <var>flagSet</var> must be set in the
     new browsing context's <span>popup sandboxing flag set</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>
