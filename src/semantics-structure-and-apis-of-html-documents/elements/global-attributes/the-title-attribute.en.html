  <h5>The <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-title">title</code></dfn> attribute <span>represents</span> advisory
  information for the element, such as would be appropriate for a tooltip. On a link, this could be
  the title or a description of the target resource; on an image, it could be the image credit or a
  description of the image; on a paragraph, it could be a footnote or commentary on the text; on a
  citation, it could be further information about the source; on <span>interactive content</span>,
  it could be a label for, or instructions for, use of the element; and so forth. The value is
  text.</p>

  <!-- search for title-warning if modifying this paragraph -->
  <p class="note">Relying on the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute is currently
  discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by
  this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear,
  which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or
  tablet).</p>

  <p>If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies that the <code
  data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute of the nearest ancestor <span data-x="HTML elements">HTML
  element</span> with a <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute set is also relevant to this
  element. Setting the attribute overrides this, explicitly stating that the advisory information of
  any ancestors is not relevant to this element. Setting the attribute to the empty string indicates
  that the element has no advisory information.</p>

  <p>If the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute's value contains U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  characters, the content is split into multiple lines. Each U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character
  represents a line break.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Caution is advised with respect to the use of newlines in <code
   data-x="attr-title">title</code> attributes.</p>

   <p>For instance, the following snippet actually defines an abbreviation's expansion <em>with a
   line break in it</em>:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;p>My logs show that there was some interest in &lt;abbr title="Hypertext
Transport Protocol">HTTP&lt;/abbr> today.&lt;/p></pre> <!-- DO NOT REWRAP THIS LINE -->

  </div>

  <p>Some elements, such as <code>link</code>, <code>abbr</code>, and <code>input</code>, define
  additional semantics for the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute beyond the semantics
  described above.</p> <!-- the other two are <code>style</code> and <code>dfn</code> -->

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn>advisory information</dfn> of an element is the value that the following algorithm
  returns, with the algorithm being aborted once a value is returned. When the algorithm returns the
  empty string, then there is no advisory information.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element is a <code>link</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>dfn</code>,
   <code>abbr</code>, or <code>menuitem</code> element, then: if the element has a <code
   data-x="">title</code> attribute, <!-- not attr-title --> return the value of that attribute,
   otherwise, return the empty string.</p></li> <!-- note: <code>input</code> doesn't do this -->

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute, then
   return its value.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a parent element, then return the parent element's
   <span>advisory information</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, return the empty string.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>User agents should inform the user when elements have <span>advisory information</span>,
  otherwise the information would not be discoverable.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-title">title</code></dfn> IDL attribute must <span>reflect</span> the
  <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> content attribute.</p>
