  <h5>The <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> and <code data-x="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attributes</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code></dfn> attribute (in no namespace) specifies the
  primary language for the element's contents and for any of the element's attributes that contain
  text. Its value must be a valid BCP 47 language tag, or the empty string. Setting the attribute to
  the empty string indicates that the primary language is unknown<!-- UA conformance requirements
  for this are below -->. <ref spec=BCP47></p>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code></dfn> attribute in the <span>XML
  namespace</span> is defined in XML. <ref spec=XML></p>

  <p>If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the language of this element is the same
  as the language of its parent element, if any.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in no namespace may be used on any <span
  data-x="HTML elements">HTML element</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attribute in the <span>XML
  namespace</span></span> may be used on <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>XML documents</span>,
  as well as elements in other namespaces if the relevant specifications allow it (in particular,
  MathML and SVG allow <span data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attributes in the
  <span>XML namespace</span></span> to be specified on their elements). If both the <code
  data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in no namespace and the <span data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code
  data-x="">lang</code> attribute in the <span>XML namespace</span></span> are specified on the same
  element, they must have exactly the same value when compared in an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use the <span data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attribute in
  the <span>XML namespace</span></span> on <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>HTML
  documents</span>. To ease migration to and from XML, authors may specify an attribute in no
  namespace with no prefix and with the literal localname "<code data-x="">xml:lang</code>" on
  <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>HTML documents</span>, but such attributes must only be
  specified if a <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in no namespace is also specified,
  and both attributes must have the same value when compared in an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p class="note">The attribute in no namespace with no prefix and with the literal localname "<code
  data-x="">xml:lang</code>" has no effect on language processing.</p>

  <p>To determine the <dfn>language</dfn> of a node, user agents must look at the nearest ancestor
  element (including the element itself if the node is an element) that has a <span
  data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attribute in the <span>XML
  namespace</span></span> set or is an <span data-x="HTML elements">HTML element</span> and has a
  <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> in no namespace attribute set. That attribute specifies the
  language of the node (regardless of its value).</p>

  <p>If both the <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in no namespace and the <span
  data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attribute in the <span>XML
  namespace</span></span> are set on an element, user agents must use the <span
  data-x="attr-xml-lang"><code data-x="">lang</code> attribute in the <span>XML
  namespace</span></span>, and the <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in no namespace
  must be <span data-x="ignore">ignored</span> for the purposes of determining the element's
  language.</p>

  <p>If node's <span data-x="inclusive ancestor">inclusive ancestors</span> do not have either
  attribute set, but there is a <span>pragma-set default language</span> set, then that is the
  language of the node. If there is no <span>pragma-set default language</span> set, then language
  information from a higher-level protocol (such as HTTP), if any, must be used as the final
  fallback language instead. In the absence of any such language information, and in cases where the
  higher-level protocol reports multiple languages, the language of the node is unknown, and the
  corresponding language tag is the empty string.</p>

  <p>If the resulting value is not a recognized language tag, then it must be treated as an unknown
  language having the given language tag, distinct from all other languages. For the purposes of
  round-tripping or communicating with other services that expect language tags, user agents should
  pass unknown language tags through unmodified, and tagged as being BCP 47 language tags, so that
  subsequent services do not interpret the data as another type of language description. <ref spec=BCP47></p>

  <p class="example">Thus, for instance, an element with <code data-x="">lang="xyzzy"</code> would be
  matched by the selector <code data-x="">:lang(xyzzy)</code> (e.g. in CSS), but it would not be
  matched by <code data-x="">:lang(abcde)</code>, even though both are equally invalid. Similarly, if
  a Web browser and screen reader working in unison communicated about the language of the element,
  the browser would tell the screen reader that the language was "xyzzy", even if it knew it was
  invalid, just in case the screen reader actually supported a language with that tag after all.
  Even if the screen reader supported both BCP 47 and another syntax for encoding language names,
  and in that other syntax the string "xyzzy" was a way to denote the Belarusian language, it would
  be <em>incorrect</em> for the screen reader to then start treating text as Belarusian, because
  "xyzzy" is not how Belarusian is described in BCP 47 codes (BCP 47 uses the code "be" for
  Belarusian).</p>

  <p>If the resulting value is the empty string, then it must be interpreted as meaning that the
  language of the node is explicitly unknown.</p>

  <p>User agents may use the element's language to determine proper processing or rendering (e.g. in
  the selection of appropriate fonts or pronunciations, for dictionary selection, or for the user
  interfaces of form controls such as date pickers). <!--User agents must not use the element's
  language to determine text directionality. (commented out because text directionality is a
  rendering-level concern.)--></p>

  <!-- Date pickers would use the language information for determining the language of months, for
  example. They should use the page's _locale_ to figure out the format itself, not the language.
  There's currently no way to determine the page's locale except by guessing from the charset and
  language... -->
