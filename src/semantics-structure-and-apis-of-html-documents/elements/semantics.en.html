<h4>Semantics</h4>

  <p>Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined (by this specification) to have
  certain meanings (semantics). For example, the <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list,
  and the <code data-x="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute represents the language of the content.</p>

  <p>These definitions allow HTML processors, such as Web browsers or search engines, to present and
  use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts that the author might not have
  considered.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>As a simple example, consider a Web page written by an author who only considered desktop
   computer Web browsers:</p>

   <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lt;html lang="en">
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>My Page&lt;/title>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;h1>Welcome to my page&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>I like cars and lorries and have a big Jeep!&lt;/p>
  &lt;h2>Where I live&lt;/h2>
  &lt;p>I live in a small hut on a mountain!&lt;/p>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

   <p>Because HTML conveys <em>meaning</em>, rather than presentation, the same
   page can also be used by a small browser on a mobile phone, without any change to the page.
   Instead of headings being in large letters as on the desktop, for example, the browser on the
   mobile phone might use the same size text for the whole the page, but with the headings in
   bold.</p>

   <p>But it goes further than just differences in screen size: the same page could equally be used
   by a blind user using a browser based around speech synthesis, which instead of displaying the
   page on a screen, reads the page to the user, e.g. using headphones. Instead of large text for
   the headings, the speech browser might use a different volume or a slower voice.</p>

   <p>That's not all, either. Since the browsers know which parts of the page are the headings, they
   can create a document outline that the user can use to quickly navigate around the document,
   using keys for "jump to next heading" or "jump to previous heading". Such features are especially
   common with speech browsers, where users would otherwise find quickly navigating a page quite
   difficult.</p>

   <p>Even beyond browsers, software can make use of this information. Search engines can use the
   headings to more effectively index a page, or to provide quick links to subsections of the page
   from their results. Tools can use the headings to create a table of contents (that is in fact how
   this very specification's table of contents is generated).</p>

   <p>This example has focused on headings, but the same principle applies to all of the semantics
   in HTML.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values for purposes other than their
  appropriate intended semantic purpose, as doing so prevents software from correctly processing the
  page.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, the following snippet, intended to represent the heading of a
   corporate site, is non-conforming because the second line is not intended to
   be a heading of a subsection, but merely a subheading or subtitle (a
   subordinate heading for the same section).</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;ACME Corporation&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;The leaders in arbitrary fast delivery since 1920&lt;/h2&gt;
 ...</pre>

   <p>The <code>hgroup</code> element is intended for these kinds of situations:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;hgroup&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;ACME Corporation&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;The leaders in arbitrary fast delivery since 1920&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;/hgroup&gt;
 ...</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The document in this next example is similarly non-conforming, despite
   being syntactically correct, because the data placed in the cells is clearly
   not tabular data, and the <code>cite</code> element mis-used:</p>

   <pre class="bad" lang="en-GB">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; <!--en-GB-->My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
     &mdash;&lt;a href="https://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ernest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
     in an essay from 1992
    &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

   <p>This would make software that relies on these semantics fail: for example,
   a speech browser that allowed a blind user to navigate tables in the document
   would report the quote above as a table, confusing the user; similarly, a
   tool that extracted titles of works from pages would extract "Ernest" as the
   title of a work, even though it's actually a person's name, not a title.</p>

   <p>A corrected version of this document might be:</p>

   <pre lang="en-GB">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt; <!--en-GB-->My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &mdash;&lt;a href="https://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;Ernest&lt;/a&gt;,
   in an essay from 1992
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values that are not permitted by this
  specification or <span>other applicable specifications</span>, as doing so makes it significantly
  harder for the language to be extended in the future.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the next example, there is a non-conforming attribute value ("carpet") and a non-conforming
   attribute ("texture"), which is not permitted by this specification:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;label&gt;Carpet: &lt;input type="carpet" name="c" texture="deep pile"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</pre>

   <p>Here would be an alternative and correct way to mark this up:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label&gt;Carpet: &lt;input type="text" class="carpet" name="c" data-texture="deep pile"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</pre>

  </div>

  <p id="no-browsing-context">DOM nodes whose <span>node document</span> does not have a
  <span>browsing context</span> are exempt from all document conformance requirements other than the
  <a href="#writing">HTML syntax</a> requirements and <a href="#writing-xhtml-documents">XML
  syntax</a> requirements.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In particular, the <code>template</code> element's <span>template contents</span>'s <span>node
   document</span> does not have a <span>browsing context</span>. For example, the <span
   data-x="concept-element-content-model">content model</span> requirements and attribute value
   microsyntax requirements do not apply to a <code>template</code> element's <span>template
   contents</span>. In this example an <code>img</code> element has attribute values that are
   placeholders that would be invalid outside a <code>template</code> element.</p>

   <pre>&lt;template>
 &lt;article>
  &lt;img <mark>src="{{src}}" alt="{{alt}}"</mark>>
  &lt;h1>&lt;/h1>
 &lt;/article>
&lt;/template></pre>

   <p>However, if the above markup were to omit the <code data-x="">&lt;/h1></code> end tag, that
   would be a violation of the <a href="#writing">HTML syntax</a>, and would thus be flagged as an
   error by conformance checkers.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Through scripting and using other mechanisms, the values of attributes, text, and indeed the
  entire structure of the document may change dynamically while a user agent is processing it. The
  semantics of a document at an instant in time are those represented by the state of the document
  at that instant in time, and the semantics of a document can therefore change over time. User
  agents <span w-nodev>must</span> update their presentation of the document as this
  occurs.</p>

  <p class="example">HTML has a <code>progress</code> element that describes a progress bar. If its
  "value" attribute is dynamically updated by a script, the UA would update the rendering to show
  the progress changing.</p>
