  <h5>User agent conformance criteria</h5>

  <p>User agents must implement the Unicode bidirectional algorithm to determine the proper ordering
  of characters when rendering documents and parts of documents. <ref spec=BIDI></p>

  <p>The mapping of HTML to the Unicode bidirectional algorithm must be done in one of three ways.
  Either the user agent must implement CSS, including in particular the CSS
  <span>'unicode-bidi'</span>, <span>'direction'</span>, and <span>'content'</span> properties, and
  must have, in its user agent style sheet, the rules using those properties given in this
  specification's <a href="#rendering">rendering</a> section, or, alternatively, the user agent must
  act as if it implemented just the aforementioned properties and had a user agent style sheet that
  included all the aforementioned rules, but without letting style sheets specified in documents
  override them, or, alternatively, the user agent must implement another styling language with
  equivalent semantics. <ref spec=CSSGC></p>

  <p id="bidireq">The following elements and attributes have requirements defined by the <a
  href="#rendering">rendering</a> section that, due to the requirements in this section, are
  requirements on all user agents (not just those that <a href="#renderingUA">support the suggested
  default rendering</a>):</p>
