  <h5>Paragraphs</h5>

  <p class="note">The term <span>paragraph</span> as defined in this section is used for more than
  just the definition of the <code>p</code> element. The <span>paragraph</span> concept defined here
  is used to describe how to interpret documents. The <code>p</code> element is merely one of
  several ways of marking up a <span>paragraph</span>.</p>

  <!-- note: the actual definition is below -->
  <p>A <dfn>paragraph</dfn> is typically a run of <span>phrasing content</span> that forms a block
  of text with one or more sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also
  be used for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a
  part of a form, a byline, or a stanza in a poem.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, there are two paragraphs in a section. There is also a heading,
   which contains phrasing content that is not a paragraph. Note how the comments and
   <span>inter-element whitespace</span> do not form paragraphs.</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
  &lt;h1>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h1>
  This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in this example.
  &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>
  &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Paragraphs in <span>flow content</span> are defined relative to what the document looks like
  without the <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code>, <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements
  complicating matters, since those elements, with their hybrid content models, can straddle
  paragraph boundaries, as shown in the first two examples below.</p>

  <p class="note">Generally, having elements straddle paragraph boundaries is best avoided.
  Maintaining such markup can be difficult.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example takes the markup from the earlier example and puts <code>ins</code> and
   <code>del</code> elements around some of the markup to show that the text was changed (though in
   this case, the changes admittedly don't make much sense). Notice how this example has exactly the
   same paragraphs as the previous one, despite the <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements
   &mdash; the <code>ins</code> element straddles the heading and the first paragraph, and the
   <code>del</code> element straddles the boundary between the two paragraphs.</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
  &lt;ins>&lt;h1>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h1>
  This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in&lt;/ins> this example&lt;del>.
  &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>&lt;/del>
  &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Let <var>view</var> be a view of the DOM that replaces all <code>a</code>,
  <code>ins</code>, <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements in the document with their <span
  data-x="concept-html-contents">contents</span>. Then, in <var>view</var>, for each run
  of sibling <span>phrasing content</span> nodes uninterrupted by other types of content, in an
  element that accepts content other than <span>phrasing content</span> as well as <span>phrasing
  content</span>, let <var>first</var> be the first node of the run, and let <var>last</var> be the last node of the run. For each such run that consists of at least one
  node that is neither <span>embedded content</span> nor <span>inter-element whitespace</span>, a
  paragraph exists in the original DOM from immediately before <var>first</var> to
  immediately after <var>last</var>. (Paragraphs can thus span across <code>a</code>,
  <code>ins</code>, <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements.)</p>

  <p>Conformance checkers may warn authors of cases where they have paragraphs that overlap each
  other (this can happen with <code>object</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>audio</code>, and
  <code>canvas</code> elements, and indirectly through elements in other namespaces that allow HTML
  to be further embedded therein, like <span>SVG <code>svg</code></span> or <span>MathML
  <code>math</code></span>).</p>
  <!-- example below -->

  </div>

  <p>A <span>paragraph</span> is also formed explicitly by <code>p</code> elements.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>p</code> element can be used to wrap individual paragraphs when there
  would otherwise not be any content other than phrasing content to separate the paragraphs from
  each other.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the link spans half of the first paragraph, all of the heading
   separating the two paragraphs, and half of the second paragraph. It straddles the paragraphs and
   the heading.</p>

   <pre>&lt;header>
 Welcome!
 &lt;a href="about.html">
  This is home of...
  &lt;h1>The Falcons!&lt;/h1>
  The Lockheed Martin multirole jet fighter aircraft!
 &lt;/a>
 This page discusses the F-16 Fighting Falcon's innermost secrets.
&lt;/header></pre>

   <p>Here is another way of marking this up, this time showing the paragraphs explicitly, and
   splitting the one link element into three:</p>

   <pre>&lt;header>
 &lt;p>Welcome! &lt;a href="about.html">This is home of...&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;h1>&lt;a href="about.html">The Falcons!&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="about.html">The Lockheed Martin multirole jet
 fighter aircraft!&lt;/a> This page discusses the F-16 Fighting
 Falcon's innermost secrets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/header></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <!-- I don't know if there's a better way to deal with this, but if there is, let me know... -->

   <p>It is possible for paragraphs to overlap when using certain elements that define fallback
   content. For example, in the following section:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;h1>My Cats&lt;/h1>
 You can play with my cat simulator.
 &lt;object data="cats.sim">
  To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:
  &lt;ul>
   &lt;li>&lt;a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file&lt;/a>
   &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator&lt;/a>
  &lt;/ul>
  Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.
 &lt;/object>
 I'm quite proud of it.
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>There are five paragraphs:</p>

   <ol class="brief">

    <li>The paragraph that says "You can play with my cat simulator. <i>object</i> I'm
    quite proud of it.", where <i>object</i> is the <code>object</code> element.</li>

    <li>The paragraph that says "To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:".</li>

    <li>The paragraph that says "Download simulator file".</li>

    <li>The paragraph that says "Use online simulator".</li>

    <li>The paragraph that says "Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.".</li>

   </ol>

   <p>The first paragraph is overlapped by the other four. A user agent that supports the "cats.sim"
   resource will only show the first one, but a user agent that shows the fallback will confusingly
   show the first sentence of the first paragraph as if it was in the same paragraph as the second
   one, and will show the last paragraph as if it was at the start of the second sentence of the
   first paragraph.</p>

   <p>To avoid this confusion, explicit <code>p</code> elements can be used. For example:</p>

   <!-- My Fish -->
   <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;h1>My Cats&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>You can play with my cat simulator.&lt;/p>
 &lt;object data="cats.sim">
  &lt;p>To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:&lt;/p>
  &lt;ul>
   &lt;li>&lt;a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file&lt;/a>
   &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator&lt;/a>
  &lt;/ul>
  &lt;p>Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/object>
 &lt;p>I'm quite proud of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>
