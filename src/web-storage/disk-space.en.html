<h3>Disk space</h3>

  <p>User agents should limit the total amount of space allowed for storage areas, because hostile
  authors could otherwise use this feature to exhaust the user's available disk space.</p>

  <p>User agents should guard against sites storing data under their origin's other affiliated
  sites, e.g. storing up to the limit in a1.example.com, a2.example.com, a3.example.com, etc,
  circumventing the main example.com storage limit.</p>

  <p>User agents may prompt the user when quotas are reached, allowing the user to grant a site more
  space. This enables sites to store many user-created documents on the user's computer, for
  instance.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to see how much space each domain is using.</p>

  <!--<p>If the storage area space limit is reached during a <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> call, the method will throw an exception.</p>-->

  <p>A mostly arbitrary limit of five megabytes per <span>origin</span> is suggested. Implementation
  feedback is welcome and will be used to update this suggestion in the future.</p>

  <p>For predictability, quotas should be based on the uncompressed size of data stored.</p>
