  <h4>The <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute</h4>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>WindowLocalStorage</dfn> {
  readonly attribute <span>Storage</span> <span data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</span>;
};
<span>Window</span> implements <span>WindowLocalStorage</span>;</pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code></dfn> object provides a
  <code>Storage</code> object for an <span>origin</span>.
  <!--INSERT FINGERPRINT-->
  </p>

  <p>User agents must have a set of local storage areas, one for each <span>origin</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should expire data from the local storage areas only for security reasons or when
  requested to do so by the user. User agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that
  could access that data is running.</p>

  <p>When the <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute is accessed, the user
  agent must run the following steps, which are known as the
  <!--en-GB--><dfn id="storage-object-initialisation-steps"><code>Storage</code> object
  initialization steps</dfn>:</p> <!-- these steps are named because marcos uses them from another
  spec -->

  <ol>

   <li><p>The user agent may throw a <span>"<code>SecurityError</code>"</span>
   <code>DOMException</code> and abort these steps instead of returning a <code>Storage</code>
   object if the request violates a policy decisions (e.g. if the user agent is configured to not
   allow the page to persist data).</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <code>Document</code>'s <span>origin</span> is an <span
   data-x="concept-origin-opaque">opaque origin</span>, then throw a
   <span>"<code>SecurityError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code> and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Check to see if the user agent has allocated a local storage area for the
   <span>origin</span> of the <code>Document</code> of the <code>Window</code> object on which the
   attribute was accessed. If it has not, create a new storage area for that
   <span>origin</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return the <code>Storage</code> object associated with that origin's local storage area.
   Each <code>Document</code> object must have a separate object for its <code>Window</code>'s <code
   data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute.</p>

  </ol>

  <p id="localStorageEvent">When the <code data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are called on a <code>Storage</code> object <var>x</var> that is associated with a local storage area, if the methods did not throw an
  exception or "do nothing" as defined above, then for every <code>Document</code> object whose
  <code>Window</code> object's <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute's
  <code>Storage</code> object is associated with the same storage area, other than <var>x</var>, <span>send a storage notification</span>.

  <p class="warning">The <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute provides
  access to shared state. This specification does not define the interaction with other browsing
  contexts in a multiprocess user agent, and authors are encouraged to assume that there is no
  locking mechanism. A site could, for instance, try to read the value of a key, increment its
  value, then write it back out, using the new value as a unique identifier for the session; if the
  site does this twice in two different browser windows at the same time, it might end up using the
  same "unique" identifier for both sessions, with potentially disastrous effects.</p>
