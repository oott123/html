  <h4>Cross-directory attacks</h4>

  <p>Different authors sharing one host name, for example users hosting content on the now defunct
  <code data-x="">geocities.com</code>, all share one local storage object. There is no feature to
  restrict the access by pathname. Authors on shared hosts are therefore urged to avoid using these
  features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data and overwrite it.</p>

  <p class="note">Even if a path-restriction feature was made available, the usual DOM scripting
  security model would make it trivial to bypass this protection and access the data from any
  path.</p>
