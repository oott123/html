<h4>Implementation risks</h4>

  <p>The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage features are letting hostile
  sites read information from other domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is
  then read from other domains.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be read from their domain causes
  <em>information leakage</em>, For example, a user's shopping wishlist on one domain could be used
  by another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's work-in-progress confidential documents
  stored by a word-processing site could be examined by the site of a competing company.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of other domains can result in
  <em>information spoofing</em>, which is equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add
  items to a user's wishlist; or a hostile site could set a user's session identifier to a known ID
  that the hostile site can then use to track the user's actions on the victim site.</p>

  <p>Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described in this specification is
  important for user security.</p>
