  <h4>DNS spoofing attacks</h4>

  <p>Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot guarantee that a host claiming to
  be in a certain domain really is from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use TLS. Pages
  using TLS can be sure that only the user, software working on behalf of the user, and other pages
  using TLS that have certificates identifying them as being from the same domain, can access their
  storage areas.</p>
