  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification introduces two related mechanisms, similar to HTTP session cookies, for
  storing name-value pairs on the client side. <ref spec=COOKIES></p>

  <p>The first is designed for scenarios where the user is carrying out a single transaction, but
  could be carrying out multiple transactions in different windows at the same time.</p>

  <p>Cookies don't really handle this case well. For example, a user could be buying plane tickets
  in two different windows, using the same site. If the site used cookies to keep track of which
  ticket the user was buying, then as the user clicked from page to page in both windows, the ticket
  currently being purchased would "leak" from one window to the other, potentially causing the user
  to buy two tickets for the same flight without really noticing.</p>

  <p>To address this, this specification introduces the <code
  data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> IDL attribute. Sites can add data to the session
  storage, and it will be accessible to any page from the same site opened in that window.</p> <!--
  we're not using xrefs here because this is just an intro -->

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, a page could have a checkbox that the user ticks to
   indicate that they want insurance:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>
 &lt;input type="checkbox" onchange="sessionStorage.insurance = checked ? 'true' : ''">
  I want insurance on this trip.
&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>A later page could then check, from script, whether the user had checked the checkbox or
   not:</p>

   <pre>if (sessionStorage.insurance) { ... }</pre>

   <p>If the user had multiple windows opened on the site, each one would have its own individual
   copy of the session storage object.</p>

  </div>

  <!--

   sessionStorage.flightDeparture = 'OSL';
   sessionStorage.flightArrival = 'NYC';

   for (var i in forms[0].elements)
      sessionStorage["data_" + i.name] = i.value;

   // if we add storage of non-strings
   if (!sessionStorage[documents])
     sessionStorage[documents] = {};
   sessionStorage[documents][filename] = <document/>;

  -->

  <p>The second storage mechanism is designed for storage that spans multiple windows, and lasts
  beyond the current session. In particular, Web applications may wish to store megabytes of user
  data, such as entire user-authored documents or a user's mailbox, on the client side for
  performance reasons.</p>

  <p>Again, cookies do not handle this case well, because they are transmitted with every
  request.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> IDL attribute is used to access a page's
  local storage area.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The site at example.com can display a count of how many times the user has loaded its page by
   putting the following at the bottom of its page:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>
  You have viewed this page
  &lt;span id="count">an untold number of&lt;/span>
  time(s).
&lt;/p>
&lt;script>
  if (!localStorage.pageLoadCount)
    localStorage.pageLoadCount = 0;
  localStorage.pageLoadCount = parseInt(localStorage.pageLoadCount) + 1;
  document.getElementById('count').textContent = localStorage.pageLoadCount;
&lt;/script></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Each site has its own separate storage area.</p>
