<h4>Sensitivity of data</h4>

  <p>User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially sensitive; it's quite possible
  for e-mails, calendar appointments, health records, or other confidential documents to be stored
  in this mechanism.</p>

  <p>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data, it is promptly deleted from the
  underlying storage.</p>
