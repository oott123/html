<h4>Extracting character encodings from <code>meta</code> elements</h4>

  <p>The <dfn>algorithm for extracting a character encoding from a <code>meta</code> element</dfn>,
  given a string <var>s</var>, is as follows. It either returns a character encoding or
  nothing.</p>

  <ol> <!-- https://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/encoding/all.html -->

   <li><p>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>s</var>, initially
   pointing at the start of the string.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Loop</i>: Find the first seven characters in <var>s</var> after <var>position</var> that are an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the word "<code
   data-x="">charset</code>". If no such match is found, return nothing and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Skip any <span data-x="space character">space characters</span> that immediately follow the
   word "<code data-x="">charset</code>" (there might not be any).</p></li>

   <li><p>If the next character is not a U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=), then move <var>position</var> to point just before that next character, and jump back to the step
   labeled <i>loop</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Skip any <span data-x="space character">space characters</span> that immediately follow the
   equals sign (there might not be any).</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Process the next character as follows:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If it is a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (") and there is a later U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (") in <var>s</var></dt>
     <dt>If it is a U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (') and there is a later U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (') in <var>s</var></dt>
     <dd>Return the result of <span>getting an encoding</span> from the substring that is between
     this character and the next earliest occurrence of this character.</dd>

     <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (")</dt>
     <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (')</dt>
     <dt>If there is no next character</dt>
     <dd>Return nothing.</dd>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>
     <dd>Return the result of <span>getting an encoding</span> from the substring that consists of
     this character up to but not including the first <span>space character</span> or U+003B
     SEMICOLON character (;), or the end of <var>s</var>, whichever comes first.</dd>

    </dl>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">This algorithm is distinct from those in the HTTP specification (for example, HTTP
  doesn't allow the use of single quotes and requires supporting a backslash-escape mechanism that
  is not supported by this algorithm<!-- not to mention not having any rules for error-handling,
  which is of course why we're having to define it ourselves -->). While the algorithm is used in
  contexts that, historically, were related to HTTP, the syntax as supported by implementations
  diverged some time ago. <ref spec=HTTP></p>
