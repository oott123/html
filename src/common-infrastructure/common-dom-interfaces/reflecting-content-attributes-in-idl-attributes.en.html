<h4>Reflecting content attributes in IDL attributes</h4>

  <p>Some IDL attributes are defined to <dfn>reflect</dfn> a particular content attribute. This
  means that on getting, the IDL attribute returns the current value of the content attribute, and
  on setting, the IDL attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the given value.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>In general, on getting, if the content attribute is not present, the IDL attribute must act as
  if the content attribute's value is the empty string; and on setting, if the content attribute is
  not present, it must first be added.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code data-x="idl-USVString">USVString</code> attribute
  whose content attribute is defined to contain a <span>URL</span>, then on getting, if the
  content attribute is absent, the IDL attribute must return the empty string. Otherwise, the IDL
  attribute must <span data-x="parse a url">parse</span> the value of the content attribute relative
  to the element's <span>node document</span> and if that is successful, return the <span>resulting
  URL string</span>. If parsing fails, then the value of the content attribute must be returned
  instead, <span data-x="concept-idl-convert">converted</span> to a <code
  data-x="idl-USVString">USVString</code>. On setting, the content attribute must be set to the
  specified new value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code data-x="idl-DOMString">DOMString</code> attribute
  whose content attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>, and the IDL attribute is
  <dfn>limited to only known values</dfn>, then, on getting, the IDL attribute must return the
  conforming value associated with the state the attribute is in (in its canonical case), if any, or
  the empty string if the attribute is in a state that has no associated keyword value or if the
  attribute is not in a defined state (e.g. the attribute is missing and there is no <i
  data-x="missing value default">missing value default</i>). On setting, the content attribute must
  be set to the specified new value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is a nullable <code data-x="idl-DOMString">DOMString</code>
  attribute whose content attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>, then, on getting, if
  the corresponding content attribute is in its <i>missing value default</i> then the IDL attribute
  must return null, otherwise, the IDL attribute must return the conforming value associated with
  the state the attribute is in (in its canonical case). On setting, if the new value is null, the
  content attribute must be removed, and otherwise, the content attribute must be set to the
  specified new value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code data-x="idl-DOMString">DOMString</code> or <code
  data-x="idl-USVString">USVString</code> attribute but doesn't fall into any of the above
  categories, then the getting and setting must be done in a transparent, case-preserving manner.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is an <span>IDL enumeration</span> attribute, then, on getting,
  if the corresponding content attribute's value <span
  data-x="case-sensitive">case-sensitively</span> matches one of the enumerated values, then the IDL
  attribute must return the content attribute's value; otherwise it must return the content
  attribute's default value. On setting, the content attribute must be set to the specified new
  value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code data-x="idl-boolean">boolean</code> attribute, then on
  getting the IDL attribute must return true if the content attribute is set, and false if it is
  absent. On setting, the content attribute must be removed if the IDL attribute is set to false,
  and must be set to the empty string if the IDL attribute is set to true. (This corresponds to the
  rules for <span data-x="boolean attribute">boolean content attributes</span>.)</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code data-x="idl-long">long</code>)
  then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the <span data-x="rules for
  parsing integers">rules for parsing signed integers</span>, and if that is successful, and the
  value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the resulting value must be returned. If, on
  the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, then the
  default value must be returned instead, or 0 if there is no default value. On setting, the given
  value must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as a <span>valid
  integer</span> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code data-x="idl-long">long</code>)
  that is <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers</dfn> then, on getting, the content attribute
  must be parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span>, and if that
  is successful, and the value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the resulting value must
  be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute
  is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or &#x2212;1 if there is no default value.
  On setting, if the value is negative, the user agent must throw an
  <span>"<code>IndexSizeError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>. Otherwise, the given value
  must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as a <span>valid
  non-negative integer</span> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute
  value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has an <em>unsigned</em> integer type (<code
  data-x="idl-unsigned-long">unsigned long</code>) then, on getting, the content attribute must be
  parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span>, and if that is
  successful, and the value is in the range 0 to 2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be
  returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is
  absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if there is no default value. On setting,
  first, if the new value is in the range 0 to 2147483647, then let <var>n</var> be the new value,
  otherwise let <var>n</var> be the default value, or 0 if there is no default value; then,
  <var>n</var> must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as a
  <span>valid non-negative integer</span> and that string must be used as the new content attribute
  value.</p>

       ...for why the range is clamped to 2147483647 rather the normal unsigned long maximum value

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has an unsigned integer type (<code
  data-x="idl-unsigned-long">unsigned long</code>) that is <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers
  greater than zero</dfn>, then the behavior is similar to the previous case, but zero is not
  allowed. On getting, the content attribute must first be parsed according to the <span>rules for
  parsing non-negative integers</span>, and if that is successful, and the value is in the range 1
  to 2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or
  returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned
  instead, or 1 if there is no default value. On setting, if the value is zero, the user agent must
  throw an <span>"<code>IndexSizeError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>. Otherwise, first,
  if the new value is in the range 1 to 2147483647, then let <var>n</var> be the new value,
  otherwise let <var>n</var> be the default value, or 1 if there is no default value; then,
  <var>n</var> must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as a
  <span>valid non-negative integer</span> and that string must be used as the new content attribute
  value.</p> <!-- see previous paragraph for note about the weird range -->

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has an unsigned integer type (<code
  data-x="idl-unsigned-long">unsigned long</code>) that is <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers
  greater than zero with fallback</dfn>, then the behavior is similar to the previous case, but
  disallowed values are converted to the default value. On getting, the content attribute must first
  be parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span>, and if that is
  successful, and the value is in the range 1 to 2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be
  returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is
  absent, the default value must be returned instead. On setting, first, if the new value is in the
  range 1 to 2147483647, then let <var>n</var> be the new value, otherwise let <var>n</var> be the
  default value; then, <var>n</var> must be converted to the shortest possible string representing
  the number as a <span>valid non-negative integer</span> and that string must be used as the new
  content attribute value.</p> <!-- see previous paragraph for note about the weird range -->

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code
  data-x="idl-double">double</code> or <code data-x="idl-unrestricted-double">unrestricted
  double</code>), then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the
  <span>rules for parsing floating-point number values</span>, and if that is successful, the
  resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails, or if the attribute is absent,
  the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if there is no default value. On setting, the
  given value must be converted to the <span>best representation of the number as a floating-point
  number</span> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code
  data-x="idl-double">double</code> or <code data-x="idl-unrestricted-double">unrestricted
  double</code>) that is <dfn>limited to numbers greater than zero</dfn>, then the behavior is
  similar to the previous case, but zero and negative values are not allowed. On getting, the
  content attribute must be parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing floating-point number
  values</span>, and if that is successful and the value is greater than 0.0, the resulting value
  must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the
  attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if there is no default
  value. On setting, if the value is less than or equal to zero, then the value must be ignored.
  Otherwise, the given value must be converted to the <span>best representation of the number as a
  floating-point number</span> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute
  value.</p>

  <p class="note">The values Infinity and Not-a-Number (NaN) values throw an exception on setting,
  as defined in the Web IDL specification. <ref spec=WEBIDL></p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type <code>DOMTokenList</code>, then on getting it must
  return a <code>DOMTokenList</code> object whose associated element is the element in question and
  whose associated attribute's local name is the name of the attribute in question.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type <code>HTMLElement</code>, or an interface that
  descends from <code>HTMLElement</code>, then, on getting, it must run the following algorithm
  (stopping at the first point where a value is returned):</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the corresponding content attribute is absent, then the IDL attribute must return
   null.</li>

   <li>Let <var>candidate</var> be the element that the <code
   data-x="dom-Document-getElementById">document.getElementById()</code> method would find when
   called on the content attribute's element's <span>node document</span> if it were passed as its argument the current value of
   the corresponding content attribute.</li>

   <li>If <var>candidate</var> is null, or if it is not type-compatible with the IDL
   attribute, then the IDL attribute must return null.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, it must return <var>candidate</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>On setting, if the given element has an <code data-x="attr-id">id</code> attribute, and has the
  same <span>tree</span> as the element of the attribute being set, and the given element is the
  first element in that <span>tree</span> whose <span data-x="concept-ID">ID</span> is the value of
  that <code data-x="attr-id">id</code> attribute, then the content attribute must be set to the
  value of that <code data-x="attr-id">id</code> attribute. Otherwise, the content attribute must be
  set to the empty string.</p>
