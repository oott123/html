<h3>Case-sensitivity and string comparison</h3>

  <p>Comparing two strings in a <dfn data-export="">case-sensitive</dfn> manner means comparing them
  exactly, code point for code point.</p>

  <p>Except where otherwise stated, string comparisons must be performed in a
  <span>case-sensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p>A string <var>pattern</var> is a <dfn>prefix match</dfn> for a string <var>s</var> when
  <var>pattern</var> is not longer than <var>s</var> and truncating <var>s</var> to
  <var>pattern</var>'s length leaves the two strings as matches of each other.</p>
