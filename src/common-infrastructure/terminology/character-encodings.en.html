  <h4 id="encoding-terminology">Character encodings</h4>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="encoding" data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding">character
  encoding</dfn>, or just <i>encoding</i> where that is not ambiguous, is a defined way to convert
  between byte streams and Unicode strings, as defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard. An
  <span>encoding</span> has an <dfn data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#name">encoding
  name</dfn> and one or more <dfn data-x="encoding label"
  data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#label">encoding labels</dfn>, referred to as the
  encoding's <i>name</i> and <i>labels</i> in the Encoding standard. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p>A <dfn>UTF-16 encoding</dfn> is <span>UTF-16BE</span> or <span>UTF-16LE</span>. <ref
  spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p>An <dfn>ASCII-compatible encoding</dfn> is any <span>encoding</span> that is not a
  <span>UTF-16 encoding</span>. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p class="note">Since support for encodings that are not defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard
  is prohibited, <span data-x="UTF-16 encoding">UTF-16 encodings</span> are the only encodings that
  this specification needs to treat as not being <span
  data-x="ASCII-compatible encoding">ASCII-compatible encodings</span>.

  <p>The term <dfn>code unit</dfn> is used as defined in the Web IDL specification: a 16 bit
  unsigned integer, the smallest atomic component of a <code
  data-x="idl-DOMString">DOMString</code>. (This is a narrower definition than the one used in
  Unicode, and is not the same as a <i>code point</i>.) <ref spec=WEBIDL></p>

  <p>The term <dfn>Unicode code point</dfn> means a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> where possible, and
  an isolated surrogate code point when not. When a conformance requirement is defined in terms of
  characters or Unicode code points, a pair of <span data-x="code unit">code units</span> consisting
  of a high surrogate followed by a low surrogate must be treated as the single code point
  represented by the surrogate pair, but isolated surrogates must each be treated as the single code
  point with the value of the surrogate. <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <p>In this specification, the term <dfn>character</dfn>, when not qualified as <em>Unicode</em>
  character, is synonymous with the term <span>Unicode code point</span>.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>Unicode character</dfn> is used to mean a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> (i.e. any
  Unicode code point that is not a surrogate code point). <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <p>The <dfn>code-unit length</dfn> of a string is the number of <span data-x="code unit">code
  units</span> in that string.</p>

  <p class="note">This complexity results from the historical decision to define the DOM API in
  terms of 16 bit (UTF-16) <span data-x="code unit">code units</span>, rather than in terms of <span
  data-x="Unicode character">Unicode characters</span>.</p>
