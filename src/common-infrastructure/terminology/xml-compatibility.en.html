<h4 id="xml">XML compatibility</h4>

  <p id="html-namespace">To ease migration from HTML to XML, UAs conforming to this specification
  will place elements in HTML in the <code data-x="HTML
  namespace">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for the purposes of the DOM and
  CSS. The term "<dfn>HTML elements</dfn>", when used in this specification, refers to any element
  in that namespace, even in XML documents.</p>

  <p>Except where otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in
  the <span>HTML namespace</span> ("<code data-x="">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>"), and all
  attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>element type</dfn> is used to refer to the set of elements that have a given
  local name and namespace. For example, <code>button</code> elements are elements with the element
  type <code>button</code>, meaning they have the local name "<code data-x="">button</code>" and
  (implicitly as defined above) the <span>HTML namespace</span>.</p>

  <p>Attribute names are said to be <dfn>XML-compatible</dfn> if they match the <code
  data-x="xml-Name">Name</code> production defined in XML and they contain no U+003A COLON
  characters (:). <ref spec=XML></p>
