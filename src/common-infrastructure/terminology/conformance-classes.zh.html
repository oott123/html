  <h4>Conformance classes</h4>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for <span w-nodev>user agents
  (relevant to implementors) and</span> documents<span w-nodev> (relevant to authors and
  authoring tool implementors)</span>.</p>

  <p><dfn>Conforming documents</dfn> are those that comply with all the conformance criteria for
  documents. For readability, some of these conformance requirements are phrased as conformance
  requirements on authors; such requirements are implicitly requirements on documents: by
  definition, all documents are assumed to have had an author. (In some cases, that author may
  itself be a user agent &mdash; such user agents are subject to additional rules, as explained
  below.)</p>

  <p class="example">For example, if a requirement states that "authors must not use the <code
  data-x="">foobar</code> element", it would imply that documents are not allowed to contain
  elements named <code data-x="">foobar</code>.</p>

  <p class="note impl">There is no implied relationship between document conformance requirements
  and implementation conformance requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant
  documents as they please; the processing model described in this specification applies to
  implementations regardless of the conformity of the input documents.</p>

  <p>User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with different conformance
  requirements.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt id="interactive">Web browsers and other interactive user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span>XML 语法</span> must process elements and attributes
    from the <span>HTML namespace</span> found in XML documents as described in this specification,
    so that users can interact with them, unless the semantics of those elements have been
    overridden by other specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">A conforming Web browser would, upon finding a <code>script</code> element in
    an XML document, execute the script contained in that element. However, if the element is found
    within a transformation expressed in XSLT (assuming the user agent also supports XSLT), then the
    processor would instead treat the <code>script</code> element as an opaque element that forms
    part of the transform.</p>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span>HTML 语法</span> must process documents labeled with an
    <span>HTML MIME type</span> as described in this specification, so that users can interact with
    them.</p>

    <p>User agents that support scripting must also be conforming implementations of the IDL
    fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL specification. <ref
    spec=WEBIDL></p>

    <p class="note">Unless explicitly stated, specifications that override the semantics of HTML
    elements do not override the requirements on DOM objects representing those elements. For
    example, the <code>script</code> element in the example above would still implement the
    <code>HTMLScriptElement</code> interface.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="non-interactive">Non-interactive presentation user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>User agents that process HTML and XML documents purely to render non-interactive versions of
    them must comply to the same conformance criteria as Web browsers, except that they are exempt
    from requirements regarding user interaction.</p>

    <p class="note">Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user agents are printers
    (static UAs) and overhead displays (dynamic UAs). It is expected that most static
    non-interactive presentation user agents will also opt to <a href="#non-scripted">lack scripting
    support</a>.</p>

    <p class="example">A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA would still execute scripts,
    allowing forms to be dynamically submitted, and so forth. However, since the concept of "focus"
    is irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document, the UA would not need to support
    any of the focus-related DOM APIs.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="renderingUA">Visual user agents that support the suggested default rendering</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>User agents, whether interactive or not, may be designated (possibly as a user option) as
    supporting the suggested default rendering defined by this specification.</p>

    <p>This is not required. In particular, even user agents that do implement the suggested default
    rendering are encouraged to offer settings that override this default to improve the experience
    for the user, e.g. changing the color contrast, using different focus styles, or otherwise
    making the experience more accessible and usable to the user.</p>

    <p>User agents that are designated as supporting the suggested default rendering must, while so
    designated, implement the rules <a href="#rendering">the rendering section</a> defines as the
    behavior that user agents are <em>expected</em> to implement.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="non-scripted">User agents with no scripting support</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have their scripting features
    disabled entirely) are exempt from supporting the events and DOM interfaces mentioned in this
    specification. For the parts of this specification that are defined in terms of an events model
    or in terms of the DOM, such user agents must still act as if events and the DOM were
    supported.</p>

    <p class="note">Scripting can form an integral part of an application. Web browsers that do not
    support scripting, or that have scripting disabled, might be unable to fully convey the author's
    intent.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>

   <dd id="conformance-checkers">

    <p>Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the applicable conformance
    criteria described in this specification. Automated conformance checkers are exempt from
    detecting errors that require interpretation of the author's intent (for example, while a
    document is non-conforming if the content of a <code>blockquote</code> element is not a quote,
    conformance checkers running without the input of human judgement do not have to check that
    <code>blockquote</code> elements only contain quoted material).</p>

    <p>Conformance checkers must check that the input document conforms when parsed without a
    <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> (meaning that no scripts are run, and
    that the parser's <span>scripting flag</span> is disabled), and should also check that the input
    document conforms when parsed with a <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>
    in which scripts execute, and that the scripts never cause non-conforming states to occur other
    than transiently during script execution itself. (This is only a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST"
    requirement because it has been proven to be impossible. <ref spec=COMPUTABLE>)</p>

    <p>The term "HTML validator" can be used to refer to a conformance checker that itself conforms
    to the applicable requirements of this specification.</p>

    <div class="note">

     <p>XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of this specification. Therefore, a
     validating XML processor and a DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker. Also, since neither
     of the two authoring formats defined in this specification are applications of SGML, a
     validating SGML system cannot constitute a conformance checker either.</p>

     <p>To put it another way, there are three types of conformance criteria:</p>

     <ol>

      <li>Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.</li>

      <li>Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be checked by a machine.</li>

      <li>Criteria that can only be checked by a human.</li>

     </ol>

     <p>A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple DTD-based validator only checks
     for the first class of errors and is therefore not a conforming conformance checker according
     to this specification.</p>

    </div>
   </dd>


   <dt>Data mining tools</dt>

   <dd id="data-mining">

    <p>Applications and tools that process HTML and XML documents for reasons other than to either
    render the documents or check them for conformance should act in accordance with the semantics
    of the documents that they process.</p>

    <p class="example">A tool that generates <span data-x="outline">document outlines</span> but
    increases the nesting level for each paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for each
    section would not be conforming.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt id="editors">Authoring tools and markup generators</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Authoring tools and markup generators must generate <span>conforming documents</span>.
    Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply to authoring tools, where appropriate.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of using elements only for their
    specified purpose, but only to the extent that authoring tools are not yet able to determine
    author intent. However, authoring tools must not automatically misuse elements or encourage
    their users to do so.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, it is not conforming to use an <code>address</code> element for
    arbitrary contact information; that element can only be used for marking up contact information
    for the author of the document or section. However, since an authoring tool is likely unable to
    determine the difference, an authoring tool is exempt from that requirement. This does not mean,
    though, that authoring tools can use <code>address</code> elements for any block of italics text
    (for instance); it just means that the authoring tool doesn't have to verify that when the user
    uses a tool for inserting contact information for a section, that the user really is doing that
    and not inserting something else instead.</p>

    <p class="note">In terms of conformance checking, an editor has to output documents that conform
    to the same extent that a conformance checker will verify.</p>

    <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document, it may preserve the
    conformance errors in sections of the document that were not edited during the editing session
    (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool
    must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties: tools that work from structure
    or semantic data, and tools that work on a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing
    basis (WYSIWYG).</p>

    <p>The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author HTML, since the structure in the
    source information can be used to make informed choices regarding which HTML elements and
    attributes are most appropriate.</p>

    <p>However, WYSIWYG tools are legitimate. WYSIWYG tools should use elements they know are
    appropriate, and should not use elements that they do not know to be appropriate. This might in
    certain extreme cases mean limiting the use of flow elements to just a few elements, like
    <code>div</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>, and <code>span</code> and making liberal use
    of the <code data-x="attr-style">style</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best effort attempt at enabling
    users to create well-structured, semantically rich, media-independent content.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise
  unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out of
  memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.

  </p>

  <p>For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications, this specification describes
  two authoring formats: one based on <span data-x="XML 语法">XML</span>, and one using a <a
  href="#writing">custom format</a> inspired by SGML (referred to as <span>HTML 语法</span>).
  Implementations must support at least one of these two formats, although supporting both is
  encouraged.</p>

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on elements, attributes, methods or
  objects. Such requirements fall into two categories: those describing content model restrictions,
  and those describing implementation behavior. Those in the former category are requirements on
  documents and authoring tools. Those in the second category are requirements on user agents.
  Similarly, some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on authors; such requirements
  are to be interpreted as conformance requirements on the documents that authors produce. (In other
  words, this specification does not distinguish between conformance criteria on authors and
  conformance criteria on documents.)</p>
