  <h4>Scripting</h4>

  <p>The construction "a <code data-x="">Foo</code> object", where <code data-x="">Foo</code> is
  actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the
  interface <code data-x="">Foo</code>".</p>

  <p>An IDL attribute is said to be <dfn data-x="">getting</dfn> when its value is being retrieved
  (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <dfn data-x="">setting</dfn> when a new value is
  assigned to it.</p>

  <p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn>live</dfn>, then the attributes and methods on that object
  <span w-nodev>must</span> operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the
  data.</p>
