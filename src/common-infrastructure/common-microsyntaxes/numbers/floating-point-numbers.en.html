<h5>Floating-point numbers</h5>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid floating-point number</dfn> if it consists of:</p>

  <ol class="brief">

   <li>Optionally, a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-).</li>

   <li>One or both of the following, in the given order:

    <ol>

     <li>A series of one or more <span>ASCII digits</span>.</li>

     <li>Both of the following, in the given order:

      <ol>

       <li>A single U+002E FULL STOP character (.).</li>

       <li>A series of one or more <span>ASCII digits</span>.</li>

      </ol>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>Optionally:

    <ol>

     <li>Either a U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E character (e) or a U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E
     character (E).</li>

     <li>Optionally, a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-) or U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+).</li>

     <li>A series of one or more <span>ASCII digits</span>.</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>A <span>valid floating-point number</span> represents the number obtained by multiplying the
  significand by ten raised to the power of the exponent, where the significand is the first number,
  interpreted as base ten (including the decimal point and the number after the decimal point, if
  any, and interpreting the significand as a negative number if the whole string starts with a
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-) and the number is not zero), and where the exponent is the
  number after the E, if any (interpreted as a negative number if there is a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS
  character (-) between the E and the number and the number is not zero, or else ignoring a U+002B
  PLUS SIGN character (+) between the E and the number if there is one). If there is no E, then the
  exponent is treated as zero.</p>

  <p class="note">The Infinity and Not-a-Number (NaN) values are not <span data-x="valid
  floating-point number">valid floating-point numbers</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>valid floating-point number</span> concept is typically only used to
  restrict what is allowed for authors, while the user agent requirements use the <span>rules for
  parsing floating-point number values</span> below (e.g., the <code
  data-x="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute of the <code>progress</code> element). However, in
  some cases the user agent requirements include checking if a string is a <span>valid
  floating-point number</span> (e.g., the <span>value sanitization algorithm</span> for the <span
  data-x="attr-input-type-number">Number</span> state of the <code>input</code> element, or the
  <span>parse a srcset attribute</span> algorithm).</p>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="best representation of the number as a floating-point number">best
  representation of the number <var>n</var> as a floating-point number</dfn> is the string
  obtained from running <span>ToString</span>(<var>n</var>). The abstract operation
  <span>ToString</span> is not uniquely determined. When there are multiple possible strings that
  could be obtained from <span>ToString</span> for a particular value, the user agent must always
  return the same string for that value (though it may differ from the value used by other user
  agents).</p>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for parsing floating-point number values</dfn> are as given in the following
  algorithm. This algorithm must be aborted at the first step that returns something. This algorithm
  will return either a number or an error.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially pointing at the
   start of the string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>value</var> have the value 1.</li>

   <li><p>Let <var>divisor</var> have the value 1.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>exponent</var> have the value 1.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Skip whitespace</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, return an error.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-):</p>

    </ol>

    <p>Otherwise, if the character indicated by <var>position</var> (the first character) is a
