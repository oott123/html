  <h4>Common parser idioms</h4>

  </div>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="space character" data-export="">space characters</dfn>, for the purposes of
  this specification, are U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED (LF),
  U+000C FORM FEED (FF), and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR).</p>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="White_Space">White_Space characters</dfn> are those that have the Unicode
  property "White_Space" in the Unicode <code data-x="">PropList.txt</code> data file. <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <p class="note">This should not be confused with the "White_Space" value (abbreviated "WS") of the
  "Bidi_Class" property in the <code data-x="">Unicode.txt</code> data file.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>control characters</dfn> are those whose Unicode "General_Category" property has the
  value "Cc" in the Unicode <code data-x="">UnicodeData.txt</code> data file. <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <p>The <dfn>uppercase ASCII letters</dfn> are the characters in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL
  LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>lowercase ASCII letters</dfn> are the characters in the range U+0061 LATIN SMALL
  LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>ASCII letters</dfn> are the characters that are either <span>uppercase ASCII
  letters</span> or <span>lowercase ASCII letters</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>ASCII digits</dfn> are the characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039
  DIGIT NINE (9).</p>

  <p>The <dfn>alphanumeric ASCII characters</dfn> are those that are either <span>ASCII
  letters</span> or <span>ASCII digits</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>ASCII hex digits</dfn> are the characters in the ranges U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to
  U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9), U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+0046 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F, and U+0061
  LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>uppercase ASCII hex digits</dfn> are the characters in the ranges U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to
  U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9) and U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+0046 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F only.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>lowercase ASCII hex digits</dfn> are the characters in the ranges U+0030 DIGIT ZERO
  (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9) and U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F
  only.</p>

  <p>Some of the micro-parsers described below follow the pattern of having an <var>input</var>
  variable that holds the string being parsed, and having a <var>position</var> variable pointing at
  the next character to parse in <var>input</var>.</p>

  <p>For parsers based on this pattern, a step that requires the user agent to <dfn
  data-export="">collect a sequence of characters</dfn> means that the following algorithm must be
  run, with <var>characters</var> being the set of characters that can be collected:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>input</var> and <var>position</var> be the same variables as
   those of the same name in the algorithm that invoked these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>result</var> be the empty string.</p></li>

   <li><p>While <var>position</var> doesn't point past the end of <var>input</var> and the character
   at <var>position</var> is one of the <var>characters</var>, append that character to the end of
   <var>result</var> and advance <var>position</var> to the next character in
   <var>input</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var>result</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The step <dfn>skip whitespace</dfn> means that the user agent must <span>collect a sequence of
  characters</span> that are <span data-x="space character">space characters</span>. <!--The step
  <dfn>skip White_Space characters</dfn> means that the user agent must <span>collect a sequence of
  characters</span> that are <span>White_Space</span> characters. In both cases, the--> The collected
  characters are not used. <!--<ref spec=UNICODE>--></p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn data-export="">strip line breaks</dfn> from a string, the user
  agent must remove any U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters from that
  string.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn data-export="">strip leading and trailing whitespace</dfn> from a
  string, the user agent must remove all <span data-x="space character">space characters</span> that
  are at the start or end of the string.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn data-export="">strip and collapse whitespace</dfn> in a string, it
  must replace any sequence of one or more consecutive <span data-x="space character">space
  characters</span> in that string with a single U+0020 SPACE character, and then <span>strip
  leading and trailing whitespace</span> from that string.</p>

  <p>When a user agent has to <dfn data-export="">strictly split a string</dfn> on a particular
  delimiter character <var>delimiter</var>, it must use the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially
   pointing at the start of the string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>tokens</var> be an ordered list of tokens, initially empty.</p></li>

   <li><p>While <var>position</var> is not past the end of <var>input</var>:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p><span>Collect a sequence of characters</span> that are not the <var>delimiter</var>
     character.</p></li>

     <li><p>Append the string collected in the previous step to <var>tokens</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Advance <var>position</var> to the next character in <var>input</var>.</p></li> <!--
     skips past the delimiter -->

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>tokens</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">For the special cases of splitting a string <span data-x="split a string on
  spaces">on spaces</span> and <span data-x="split a string on commas">on commas</span>, this
  algorithm does not apply (those algorithms also perform <span data-x="strip leading and trailing
  whitespace">whitespace trimming</span>).</p>
