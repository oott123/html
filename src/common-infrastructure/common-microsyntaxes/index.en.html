  <h3>Common microsyntaxes</h3>

  <p>There are various places in HTML that accept particular data types, such as dates or numbers.
  This section describes what the conformance criteria for content in those formats is, and how to
  parse them.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p class="note">Implementors are strongly urged to carefully examine any third-party libraries
  they might consider using to implement the parsing of syntaxes described below. For example, date
  libraries are likely to implement error handling behavior that differs from what is required in
  this specification, since error-handling behavior is often not defined in specifications that
  describe date syntaxes similar to those used in this specification, and thus implementations tend
  to vary greatly in how they handle errors.</p>
