  <h4>Keywords and enumerated attributes</h4>

  <p>Some attributes are defined as taking one of a finite set of keywords. Such attributes are
  called <dfn data-x="enumerated attribute">enumerated attributes</dfn>. The keywords are each
  defined to map to a particular <em>state</em> (several keywords might map to the same state, in
  which case some of the keywords are synonyms of each other; additionally, some of the keywords can
  be said to be non-conforming, and are only in the specification for historical reasons). In
  addition, two default states can be given. The first is the <dfn><i>invalid value default</i></dfn>, the
  second is the <dfn><i>missing value default</i></dfn>.</p>

  <p>If an enumerated attribute is specified, the attribute's value must be an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> match for one of the given keywords that are not said to be
  non-conforming, with no leading or trailing whitespace.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is specified, if its value is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match
  for one of the given keywords then that keyword's state is the state that the attribute
  represents. If the attribute value matches none of the given keywords, but the attribute has an
  <i data-x="invalid value default">invalid value default</i>, then the attribute represents that state. Otherwise, if the
  attribute value matches none of the keywords but there is a <i data-x="missing value default">missing value default</i> state
  defined, then <em>that</em> is the state represented by the attribute. Otherwise, there is no
  default, and invalid values mean that there is no state represented.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is <em>not</em> specified, if there is a <i data-x="missing value default">missing value default</i> state
  defined, then that is the state represented by the (missing) attribute. Otherwise, the absence of
  the attribute means that there is no state represented.</p>

  <p class="note">The empty string can be a valid keyword.</p>
