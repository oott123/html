  <h4>Dates and times</h4>

  <p>In the algorithms below, the <dfn>number of days in month <var>month</var> of year
  <var>year</var></dfn> is: <em>31</em> if <var>month</var> is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8,
  10, or 12; <em>30</em> if <var>month</var> is 4, 6, 9, or 11; <em>29</em> if <var>month</var> is 2 and <var>year</var> is a number divisible by 400, or if <var>year</var> is a number divisible by 4 but not by 100; and <em>28</em> otherwise. This
  takes into account leap years in the Gregorian calendar. <ref spec=GREGORIAN></p>

  <p>When <span>ASCII digits</span> are used in the date and time syntaxes defined in this section,
  they express numbers in base ten.</p>

  <p class="note">While the formats described here are intended to be subsets of the corresponding
  ISO8601 formats, this specification defines parsing rules in much more detail than ISO8601.
  Implementors are therefore encouraged to carefully examine any date parsing libraries before using
  them to implement the parsing rules described below; ISO8601 libraries might not parse dates and
  times in exactly the same manner. <ref spec=ISO8601></p>

  </div>

  <p>Where this specification refers to the <dfn>proleptic Gregorian calendar</dfn>, it means the
  modern Gregorian calendar, extrapolated backwards to year 1. A date in the <span>proleptic
  Gregorian calendar</span>, sometimes explicitly referred to as a <dfn>proleptic-Gregorian
  date</dfn>, is one that is described using that calendar even if that calendar was not in use at
  the time (or place) in question. <ref spec=GREGORIAN></p>

  <p class="note">The use of the Gregorian calendar as the wire format in this specification is an
  arbitrary choice resulting from the cultural biases of those involved in the decision. See also
  the section discussing <a href="#input-author-notes">date, time, and number formats</a> in forms
  <span w-nodev>(for authors), <a href="#input-impl-notes">implementation notes regarding
  localization of form controls</a>,</span> and the <code>time</code> element.</p>
