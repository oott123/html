<h3>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code></dfn> attribute</h3>

  <p>All <span>HTML elements</span> may have the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> content
  attribute set. The <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute is a <span>boolean
  attribute</span>. When specified on an element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no
  longer, directly relevant to the page's current state, or that it is being used to declare content
  to be reused by other parts of the page as opposed to being directly accessed by the user. <span
  w-nodev>User agents should not render elements that have the <code
  data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute specified. This requirement may be implemented
  indirectly through the style layer. For example, an HTML+CSS user agent could implement these
  requirements <a href="#hiddenCSS">using the rules suggested in the Rendering
  section</a>.</span></p>

  <p class="note">Because this attribute is typically implemented using CSS, it's also possible to
  override it using CSS. For instance, a rule that applies 'display: block' to all elements will
  cancel the effects of the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute. Authors therefore
  have to take care when writing their style sheets to make sure that the attribute is still styled
  as expected.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following skeletal example, the attribute is used to hide the Web game's main screen
   until the user logs in:</p>

   <pre>  &lt;h1>The Example Game&lt;/h1>
  &lt;section id="login">
   &lt;h2>Login&lt;/h2>
   &lt;form>
    ...
    &lt;!-- calls login() once the user's credentials have been checked -->
   &lt;/form>
   &lt;script>
    function login() {
      // switch screens
      document.getElementById('login').hidden = true;
      document.getElementById('game').hidden = false;
    }
   &lt;/script>
  &lt;/section>
  &lt;section id="game" hidden>
   ...
  &lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute must not be used to hide content that
  could legitimately be shown in another presentation. For example, it is incorrect to use <code
  data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> to hide panels in a tabbed dialog, because the tabbed interface
  is merely a kind of overflow presentation &mdash; one could equally well just show all the form
  controls in one big page with a scrollbar. It is similarly incorrect to use this attribute to hide
  content just from one presentation &mdash; if something is marked <code
  data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code>, it is hidden from all presentations, including, for instance,
  screen readers.</p>

  <!-- for example, "<a hidden href=#content>Skip to content</a>" would be inappropriate. -->
  <!-- (but only add that example if you first add some more good valid examples -->

  <p>Elements that are not themselves <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> must not
  <span>hyperlink</span> to elements that are <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code>. The <code
  data-x="">for</code> attributes of <code>label</code> and <code>output</code> elements that are not
  themselves <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> must similarly not refer to elements that are
  <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code>. In both cases, such references would cause user
  confusion.</p>

  <p>Elements and scripts may, however, refer to elements that are <code
  data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> in other contexts.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, it would be incorrect to use the <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>
   attribute to link to a section marked with the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute.
   If the content is not applicable or relevant, then there is no reason to link to it.</p>

   <p>It would be fine, however, to use the ARIA <code
   data-x="attr-aria-describedby">aria-describedby</code> attribute to refer to descriptions that are
   themselves <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code>. While hiding the descriptions implies that
   they are not useful alone, they could be written in such a way that they are useful in the
   specific context of being referenced from the images that they describe.</p>

   <p>Similarly, a <code>canvas</code> element with the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code>
   attribute could be used by a scripted graphics engine as an off-screen buffer, and a form control
   could refer to a hidden <code>form</code> element using its <code
   data-x="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Elements in a section hidden by the <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute are still
  active, e.g. scripts and form controls in such sections still execute and submit respectively.
  Only their presentation to the user changes.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-hidden">hidden</code></dfn> IDL attribute must <span>reflect</span>
  the content attribute of the same name.</p>

  </div>
