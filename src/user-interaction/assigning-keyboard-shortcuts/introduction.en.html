  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Each element that can be activated or focused can be assigned a single key combination to
  activate it, using the <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>The exact shortcut is determined by the user agent, based on information about the user's
  keyboard, what keyboard shortcuts already exist on the platform, and what other shortcuts have
  been specified on the page, using the information provided in the <code
  data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute as a guide.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that a relevant keyboard shortcut is available on a wide variety of input
  devices, the author can provide a number of alternatives in the <code
  data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>Each alternative consists of a single character, such as a letter or digit.</p>

  <p>User agents can provide users with a list of the keyboard shortcuts, but authors are encouraged
  to do so also. The <code data-x="dom-accessKeyLabel">accessKeyLabel</code> IDL attribute returns a
  string representing the actual key combination assigned by the user agent.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, an author has provided a button that can be invoked using a shortcut key. To
   support full keyboards, the author has provided "C" as a possible key. To support devices
   equipped only with numeric keypads, the author has provided "1" as another possibly key.</p>

   <pre>&lt;input type=button value=Collect onclick="collect()"
       <strong>accesskey="C 1"</strong> id=c></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>To tell the user what the shortcut key is, the author has this script here opted to explicitly
   add the key combination to the button's label:</p>

   <pre>function addShortcutKeyLabel(button) {
<strong>  if (button.accessKeyLabel != '')
    button.value += ' (' + button.accessKeyLabel + ')';</strong>
}
addShortcutKeyLabel(document.getElementById('c'));</pre>

   <p>Browsers on different platforms will show different labels, even for the same key combination,
   based on the convention prevalent on that platform. For example, if the key combination is the
   Control key, the Shift key, and the letter C, a Windows browser might display
   "<samp>Ctrl+Shift+C</samp>", whereas a Mac browser might display "<samp>^&#x21E7;C</samp>", while
   an Emacs browser might just display "<samp>C-C</samp>". Similarly, if the key combination is the
   Alt key and the Escape key, Windows might use "<samp>Alt+Esc</samp>", Mac might use
   "<samp>&#x2325;&#x238B;</samp>", and an Emacs browser might use "<samp>M-ESC</samp>" or
   "<samp>ESC ESC</samp>".</p>

   <p>In general, therefore, it is unwise to attempt to parse the value returned from the <code
   data-x="dom-accessKeyLabel">accessKeyLabel</code> IDL attribute.</p>
