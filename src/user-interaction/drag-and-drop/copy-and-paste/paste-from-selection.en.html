<h5>Paste from selection</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a selection paste operation, the user agent must act as if the user had
  invoked a drag on the current selection, then indicated (as the <span>immediate user
  selection</span>) the element with the keyboard focus, and then ended the drag-and-drop operation
  without canceling it.</p>

  <p>All the drag-and-drop events can be involved in this process.</p>
