  <h5>Paste from clipboard</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a clipboard paste operation, the user agent must act as if the user had
  invoked a drag on a hypothetical application representing the clipboard, setting the data
  associated with the drag as the content on the clipboard (in whatever formats are available).</p>

  <p>Then, the user agent must act as if the user had indicated (as the <span>immediate user
  selection</span>) the element with the keyboard focus, and then ended the drag-and-drop operation
  without canceling it.</p>

  <p>The events involved in this process are the <code data-x="event-dnd-dragenter">dragenter</code>,
  <code data-x="event-dnd-dragover">dragover</code>, <code data-x="event-dnd-dragexit">dragexit</code>, <code
  data-x="event-dnd-dragleave">dragleave</code>, and <code data-x="event-dnd-drop">drop</code> events.</p>
