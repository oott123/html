<h4>Copy and paste</h4>

  <p>Copy-and-paste is a form of drag-and-drop: the "copy" part is equivalent to dragging content to
  another application (the "clipboard"), and the "paste" part is equivalent to dragging content
  <em>from</em> another application.</p>

  <p>Select-and-paste (a model used by mouse operations in the X Window System) is equivalent to a
  drag-and-drop operation where the source is the selection.</p>
