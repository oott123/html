<h4 id="drag-and-drop-processing-model">Processing model</h4>

  <p>When the user attempts to begin a drag operation, the user agent must run the following steps.
  User agents must act as if these steps were run even if the drag actually started in another
  document or application and the user agent was not aware that the drag was occurring until it
  intersected with a document under the user agent's purview.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Determine what is being dragged, as follows:</p>

    <p>If the drag operation was invoked on a selection, then it is the selection that is being
    dragged.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the drag operation was invoked on a <code>Document</code>, it is the first
    element, going up the ancestor chain, starting at the node that the user tried to drag, that has
    the IDL attribute <code data-x="dom-draggable">draggable</code> set to true. If there is no such
    element, then nothing is being dragged; abort these steps, the drag-and-drop operation is never
    started.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the drag operation was invoked outside the user agent's purview. What is being
    dragged is defined by the document or application where the drag was started.</p>

    <p class="note"><code>img</code> elements and <code>a</code> elements with an <code
    data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute have their <code
    data-x="dom-draggable">draggable</code> attribute set to true by default.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p><span>Create a drag data store</span>. All the DND events fired subsequently by the steps
   in this section must use this <span>drag data store</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Establish which DOM node is the <dfn>source node</dfn>, as follows:</p>

    <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, then the <span>source node</span> is the
    <code>Text</code> node that the user started the drag on (typically the <code>Text</code> node
    that the user originally clicked). If the user did not specify a particular node, for example if
    the user just told the user agent to begin a drag of "the selection", then the <span>source
    node</span> is the first <code>Text</code> node containing a part of the selection.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if it is an element that is being dragged, then the <span>source node</span> is
    the element that is being dragged.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the <span>source node</span> is part of another document or application. When this
    specification requires that an event be dispatched at the <span>source node</span> in this case,
    the user agent must instead follow the platform-specific conventions relevant to that
    situation.</p>

    <p class="note">Multiple events are fired on the <span>source node</span> during the course of
    the drag-and-drop operation.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Determine the <dfn>list of dragged nodes</dfn>, as follows:</p>

    <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, then the <span>list of dragged nodes</span>
    contains, in <span>tree order</span>, every node that is partially or completely included in the
    selection (including all their ancestors).</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the <span>list of dragged nodes</span> contains only the <span>source node</span>,
    if any.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, then add an item to the <span>drag data store
    item list</span>, with its properties set as follows:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><span>The drag data item type string</span>
     <dd>"<code>text/plain</code>"</dd>

     <dt><span>The drag data item kind</span>
     <dd><i>Plain Unicode string</i></dd>

     <dt>The actual data</dt>
     <dd>The text of the selection</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>Otherwise, if any files are being dragged, then add one item per file to the <span>drag data
    store item list</span>, with their properties set as follows:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><span>The drag data item type string</span>
     <dd>The MIME type of the file, if known, or "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" otherwise.</dd>

     <dt><span>The drag data item kind</span>
     <dd><i>File</i></dd>

     <dt>The actual data</dt>
     <dd>The file's contents and name.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p class="note">Dragging files can currently only happen from outside a <span>browsing
    context</span>, for example from a file system manager application.</p>

    <p>If the drag initiated outside of the application, the user agent must add items to the
    <span>drag data store item list</span> as appropriate for the data being dragged, honoring
    platform conventions where appropriate; however, if the platform conventions do not use <span
    data-x="MIME type">MIME types</span> to label dragged data, the user agent must make a
    best-effort attempt to map the types to MIME types, and, in any case, all the <span data-x="the
    drag data item type string">drag data item type strings</span> must be <span>converted to ASCII
    lowercase</span>.</p>

    <p>User agents may also add one or more items representing the selection or dragged element(s)
    in other forms, e.g. as HTML.</p>

   </li>

   <!-- DND-v2: text/html as an export format -->

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>list of dragged nodes</span> is not empty, then <span data-x="extracting
    JSON">extract the microdata from those nodes into a JSON form</span>, and add one item to the
    <span>drag data store item list</span>, with its properties set as follows:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><span>The drag data item type string</span>
     <dd><code>application/microdata+json</code></dd>

     <dt><span>The drag data item kind</span>
     <dd><i>Plain Unicode string</i></dd>

     <dt>The actual data</dt>
     <dd>The resulting JSON string.</dd>

    </dl>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var>urls</var> be an empty list of <span data-x="absolute URL">absolute
     URLs</span>.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>For each <var>node</var> in the <span>list of dragged nodes</span>:</p>

      <dl>

       <dt>If the node is an <code>a</code> element with an <code
       data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute</dt>

       <dd>Add to <var>urls</var> the result of <span data-x="parse a url">parsing</span> the

       <dt>If the node is an <code>img</code> element with a <code data-x="attr-img-src">src</code>
       attribute</dt>

       <dd>Add to <var>urls</var> the result of <span data-x="parse a url">parsing</span> the

       <!-- DND-v2: more -->

      </dl>

     </li>

     <li><p>If <var>urls</var> is still empty, abort these substeps.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>url string</var> be the result of concatenating the strings in <var>urls</var>,
     in the order they were added, separated by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character

     <li><p>Add one item to the <span>drag data store item list</span>, with its properties set as

       <dd><code>text/uri-list</code></dd>

       <dd><var>url string</var></dd>

      </dl>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Update the <span>drag data store default feedback</span> as appropriate for the user agent
    (if the user is dragging the selection, then the selection would likely be the basis for this
    feedback; if the user is dragging an element, then that element's rendering would be used; if
    the drag began outside the user agent, then the platform conventions for determining the drag
    feedback should be used).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Fire a DND event</span> named <code data-x="event-dnd-dragstart">dragstart</code> at the
    <span>source node</span>.</p>

    <p>If the event is canceled, then the drag-and-drop operation should not occur; abort these
    steps.</p> <!-- only a should because the UA can always allow the user to drag without the page
    knowing -->

    <p class="note">Since events with no event listeners registered are, almost by definition, never
    canceled, drag-and-drop is always available to the user if the author does not specifically
    prevent it.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Initiate the drag-and-drop operation</span> in a manner consistent with platform
    conventions, and as described below.</p>

    <p id="base-dnd-feedback">The drag-and-drop feedback must be generated from the first of the
    following sources that is available:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>The <span>drag data store bitmap</span>, if any. In this case, the <span>drag data store
     hot spot coordinate</span> should be used as hints for where to put the cursor relative to the
     resulting image. The values are expressed as distances in <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>
     from the left side and from the top side of the image respectively. <ref spec=CSS></li>

     <li>The <span>drag data store default feedback</span>.</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>From the moment that the user agent is to <dfn>initiate the drag-and-drop operation</dfn>,
  until the end of the drag-and-drop operation, device input events (e.g. mouse and keyboard events)
  must be suppressed.</p>

  <p>During the drag operation, the element directly indicated by the user as the drop target is
  called the <dfn>immediate user selection</dfn>. (Only elements can be selected by the user; other
  nodes must not be made available as drop targets.) However, the <span>immediate user
  selection</span> is not necessarily the <dfn>current target element</dfn>, which is the element
  currently selected for the drop part of the drag-and-drop operation.</p>

  <p>The <span>immediate user selection</span> changes as the user selects different elements
  (either by pointing at them with a pointing device, or by selecting them in some other way). The
  <span>current target element</span> changes when the <span>immediate user selection</span>
  changes, based on the results of event listeners in the document, as described below.</p>

  <p>Both the <span>current target element</span> and the <span>immediate user selection</span> can
  be null, which means no target element is selected. They can also both be elements in other
  (DOM-based) documents, or other (non-Web) programs altogether. (For example, a user could drag
  text to a word-processor.) The <span>current target element</span> is initially null.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is also a <dfn>current drag operation</dfn>, which can take on the values
  "<dfn><code data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-none">none</code></dfn>", "<dfn><code
  data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-copy">copy</code></dfn>", "<dfn><code
  data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-link">link</code></dfn>", and "<dfn><code
  data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-move">move</code></dfn>". Initially, it has the value
  "<code data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-none">none</code>". It is updated by the user agent
  as described in the steps below.</p>

  <p>User agents must, as soon as the drag operation is <span data-x="initiate the drag-and-drop
  operation">initiated</span> and every 350ms (&#xB1;200ms) thereafter for as long as the drag
  operation is ongoing, <span>queue a task</span> to perform the following steps in sequence:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the user agent is still performing the previous iteration of the sequence (if any) when
    the next iteration becomes due, abort these steps for this iteration (effectively "skipping
    missed frames" of the drag-and-drop operation).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Fire a DND event</span> named <code data-x="event-dnd-drag">drag</code> at the
    <span>source node</span>. If this event is canceled, the user agent must set the <span>current
    drag operation</span> to "<code data-x="concept-current-drag-operation-none">none</code>" (no
    drag operation).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code data-x="event-dnd-drag">drag</code> event was not canceled and the user has not
    ended the drag-and-drop operation, check the state of the drag-and-drop operation, as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>If the user is indicating a different <span>immediate user selection</span> than during the
      last iteration (or if this is the first iteration), and if this <span>immediate user
      selection</span> is not the same as the <span>current target element</span>, then <span>fire a
      DND event</span> named <code data-x="event-dnd-dragexit">dragexit</code> at the <span>current
      target element</span>, and then update the <span>current target element</span> as follows:</p>

  <p class="note">User agents are encouraged to consider how to react to drags near the edge of
  scrollable regions. For example, if a user drags a link to the bottom of the <span>viewport</span>
  on a long page, it might make sense to scroll the page so that the user can drop the link lower on
  the page.</p>

  <p class="note">This model is independent of which <code>Document</code> object the nodes involved
  are from; the events are fired as described above and the rest of the processing model runs as
  described above, irrespective of how many documents are involved in the operation.</p>
