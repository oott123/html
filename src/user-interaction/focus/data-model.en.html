  <h4>Data model</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>focusable area</dfn> is used to refer to regions of the interface that can become
  the target of keyboard input. Focusable areas can be elements, parts of elements, or other regions
  managed by the user agent.</p>

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> has a <dfn>DOM anchor</dfn>, which is a <code>Node</code> object
  that represents the position of the <span>focusable area</span> in the DOM. (When the <span>focusable
  area</span> is itself a <code>Node</code>, it is its own <span>DOM anchor</span>.) The <span>DOM anchor</span> is
  used in some APIs as a substitute for the <span>focusable area</span> when there is no other DOM object
  to represent the <span>focusable area</span>.</p>

  <p>The following table describes what objects can be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable
  areas</span>. The cells in the left column describe objects that can be <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span>; the cells in the right column describe the <span data-x="DOM anchor">DOM
  anchors</span> for those elements. (The cells that span both columns are non-normative examples.)</p>

  <p id="bc-focus-ergo-bcc-focus" class="note">A <span>browsing context container</span> (e.g. an

   <li><code>dialog</code> elements that have an <code data-x="attr-dialog-open">open</code>

  </ul>

  <p>The corresponding <code>Document</code> object or <code>dialog</code> element is the created

  is always a 1-to-1 mapping of <span data-x="control group">control groups</span> to <span

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> belongs to a single <span>control group</span> as follows. If

  owner object</span>, then that <span>focusable area</span> belongs to that <span>control group
  owner object</span>'s <span>control group</span>. Otherwise, the <span>focusable area</span>
  belongs to its <span>DOM anchor</span>'s nearest ancestor <span>control group owner
  object</span>'s <span>control group</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Thus:</p>
