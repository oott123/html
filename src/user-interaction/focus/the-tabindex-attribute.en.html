<h4>The <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute</h4>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code></dfn> content attribute allows authors to
  indicate that an element is supposed to be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable</span>, and
  whether it is supposed to be reachable using <span>sequential focus navigation</span> and, if so,
  what is to be the relative order of the element for the purposes of sequential focus navigation.
  The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the "tab" key to navigate through the focusable
  elements. The term "tabbing" refers to moving forward through the focusable elements that can be
  reached using sequential focus navigation.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is omitted, the user agent applies defaults. (There is no way to make an
  element that is <span>being rendered</span> be not focusable at all without <span
  data-x="concept-element-disabled">disabling</span> it or making it <span>inert</span>.)</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value
  that is a <span>valid integer</span>. Positive numbers specify the relative position of the
  element's <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> in the <span>sequential focus
  navigation order</span>, and negative numbers indicate that the control is to be unreachable by
  <span>sequential focus navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>Developers should use caution when using values other than 0 or &#x2212;1 for their <code
  data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attributes as this is complicated to do correctly.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Each element can have a <dfn id="specially-focusable">tabindex focus flag</dfn> set, as defined
  below. This flag is a factor that contributes towards determining whether an element is a
  <span>focusable area</span>, as described in the previous section.</p>

  <p>If the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute is specified on an element, it
  must be parsed using the <span>rules for parsing integers</span>. The attribute's values, or lack
  thereof, must be interpreted as follows:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>If the attribute is omitted or parsing the value returns an error</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent should follow platform conventions to determine if the element's
    <span>tabindex focus flag</span> is set and, if so, whether the element and any <span
    data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that have the element as their <span>DOM anchor</span> can
    be reached using <span>sequential focus navigation</span>, and if so, what their relative
    position in the <span>sequential focus navigation order</span> is to be.</p>

    <p>Modulo platform conventions, it is suggested that for the following elements, the
    <span>tabindex focus flag</span> be set:</p>

    <ul>

     <li><code>a</code> elements that have an <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>
     attribute</li>

     <li><code>link</code> elements that have an <code
     data-x="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute</li>

     <li><code>button</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>input</code> elements whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute are
     not in the <span data-x="attr-input-type-hidden">Hidden</span> state</li>

     <li><code>select</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>textarea</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>menuitem</code> elements</li>

     <li>Elements with a <code data-x="attr-draggable">draggable</code> attribute set, if that would
     enable the user agent to allow the user to begin a drag operations for those elements without
     the use of a pointing device</li>

     <li><span data-x="editing host">Editing hosts</span></li>

     <li><span data-x="browsing context container">Browsing context containers</span></li> <!-- like
     <iframe>s -->

    </ul>

   </dd>

   <dt id="negative-tabindex">If the value is a negative integer</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must set the element's <span>tabindex focus flag</span>, but should omit the
    element from the <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">One valid reason to ignore the requirement that sequential focus navigation not
    allow the author to lead to the element would be if the user's only mechanism for moving the
    focus is sequential focus navigation. For instance, a keyboard-only user would be unable to
    click on a text control with a negative <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code>, so that
    user's user agent would be well justified in allowing the user to tab to the control
    regardless.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is a zero</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must set the element's <span>tabindex focus flag</span>, should allow the
    element and any <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that have the element as their
    <span>DOM anchor</span> to be reached using <span>sequential focus navigation</span>, following
    platform conventions to determine the element's relative position in the <span>sequential focus
    navigation order</span>.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is greater than zero</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must set the element's <span>tabindex focus flag</span>, should allow the
    element and any <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that have the element as their
    <span>DOM anchor</span> to be reached using sequential focus navigation, and should place the element
    &mdash; referenced as <var>candidate</var> below &mdash; and the aforementioned <span
    data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> in the <span>sequential focus navigation</span>
    order so that, relative to other <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> in the
    <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>, they are:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>before any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has been omitted or whose value, when parsed,
     returns an error,</li>

     <li>before any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal to or less than zero,</li>

     <li>after any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value greater than zero but less than
     the value of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on <var>candidate</var>,</li>

     <li>after any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal to the value of the <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on <var>candidate</var> but that is
     earlier in the document in <span>tree order</span> than <var>candidate</var>,</li>

     <li>before any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal to the value of the <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on <var>candidate</var> but that is
     later in the document in <span>tree order</span> than <var>candidate</var>, and</li>

     <li>before any <span>focusable area</span> whose <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element whose <code
     data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value greater than the value of the
     <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on <var>candidate</var>.</li>

    </ul>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>An element with the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute specified is
  <span>interactive content</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-tabIndex">tabIndex</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the value of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> content
  attribute. Its default value is 0 for elements that are focusable and &#x2212;1 for elements that
  are not focusable.</p>
