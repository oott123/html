  <h4>Focus management APIs</h4>

  <dl class="domintro">

   <dt><var>document</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-document-activeElement">activeElement</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Returns the deepest element in the document through which or to which key events are being
    routed. This is, roughly speaking, the focused element in the document.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of this API, when a <span>child browsing context</span> is focused, its
    <span>browsing context container</span> is <a href="#bc-focus-ergo-bcc-focus">focused</a> in the
    <span>parent browsing context</span>. For example, if the user moves the focus to a text control
    in an <code>iframe</code>, the <code>iframe</code> is the element returned by the <code
    data-x="dom-document-activeElement">activeElement</code> API in the <code>iframe</code>'s
    <span>node document</span>.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>document</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-document-hasFocus">hasFocus</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Returns true if key events are being routed through or to the document; otherwise, returns
    false. Roughly speaking, this corresponds to the document, or a document nested inside this
    one, being focused.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>window</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-window-focus">focus</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <!-- https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=2823 -->

    <p>Moves the focus to the window's <span>browsing context</span>, if any.</p>

   </dd>

<!--
   <dt><var>window</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-window-blur">blur</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>No effect.</p>

   </dd>
-->

   <dt><var>element</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-focus">focus</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Moves the focus to the element.</p>

    <p>If the element is a <span>browsing context container</span>, moves the focus to the <span>nested browsing context</span> instead.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>element</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-blur">blur</code>()</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Moves the focus to the <span>viewport</span>. Use of this method is discouraged; if you want
    to focus the <span>viewport</span>, call the <code data-x="dom-focus">focus()</code> method on
    the <code>Document</code>'s <span>document element</span>.</p>

    <p>Do not use this method to hide the focus ring if you find the focus ring unsightly. Instead,
    use a CSS rule to override the <span>'outline'</span> property, and provide a different way to
    show what element is focused. Be aware that if an alternative focusing style isn't made
    available, the page will be significantly less usable for people who primarily navigate pages
    using a keyboard, or those with reduced vision who use focus outlines to help them navigate the
    page.</p>

    <!-- we suggest using CSS here because users can override CSS, so it's no the end of the world,
    unlike using .blur(), which cannot be easily overridden by users and completely breaks tab
    navigation. -->

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, to hide the outline from links and instead use a yellow background to indicate
     focus, you could use:</p>

     <pre>:link:focus, :visited:focus { outline: none; background: yellow; color: black; }</pre>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-document-activeElement">activeElement</code></dfn> attribute on
  <code>Document</code> objects must return the value returned by the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>candidate</var> be the <code>Document</code> on which the method was
   invoked.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>candidate</var> has a <span>dialog group</span> with a designated
   <span>focused dialog of the dialog group</span>, then let <var>candidate</var> be the
   designated <span>focused dialog of the dialog group</span>, and redo this step.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>candidate</var> has a non-empty <span>control group</span>, let <var>candidate</var> be the designated <span>focused area of the control
   group</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If <var>candidate</var> is a <span>focusable area</span>, let <var>candidate</var> be <var>candidate</var>'s <span>DOM anchor</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>candidate</var> is a <code>Document</code> that has a <span data-x="the
    body element">body element</span>, then let <var>candidate</var> be <span>the body
    element</span> of that <code>Document</code>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if <var>candidate</var> is a <code>Document</code> with a non-null <span>document
    element</span>, then let <var>candidate</var> be that <span>document element</span>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if <var>candidate</var> is a <code>Document</code>, then let <var>candidate</var> be null.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>candidate</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-document-hasFocus">hasFocus()</code></dfn> method on the
  <code>Document</code> object, when invoked, must return the result of running the <span>has focus
  steps</span> with the <code>Document</code> object as the argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-window-focus">focus()</code></dfn> method on the <code>Window</code>
  object, when invoked, must run the <span>focusing steps</span> with the <code>Window</code>
  object's <span>browsing context</span>. Additionally, if this <span>browsing context</span> is a
  <span>top-level browsing context</span>, user agents are encouraged to trigger some sort of
  notification to indicate to the user that the page is attempting to gain focus.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-window-blur">blur()</code></dfn> method on the <code>Window</code>
  object, when invoked, provides a hint to the user agent that the script believes the user probably
  is not currently interested in the contents of the <span>browsing context</span> of the
  <code>Window</code> object on which the method was invoked, but that the contents might become
  interesting again in the future.</p>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to ignore calls to this <code data-x="dom-window-blur">blur()</code>
  method entirely.</p>

  <p class="note">Historically, the <code data-x="dom-window-blur">focus()</code> and <code
  data-x="dom-window-blur">blur()</code> methods actually affected the system-level focus of the
  system widget (e.g. tab or window) that contained the <span>browsing context</span>, but hostile
  sites widely abuse this behavior to the user's detriment.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-focus">focus()</code></dfn> method on elements, when invoked, must
  run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element is marked as <i data-x="locked for focus">locked for focus</i>, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Mark the element as <dfn>locked for focus</dfn>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run the <span>focusing steps</span> for the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>Unmark the element as <i data-x="locked for focus">locked for focus</i>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-blur">blur()</code></dfn> method, when invoked, should run the
  <span>unfocusing steps</span> for the element on which the method was called. User agents may
  selectively or uniformly ignore calls to this method for usability reasons.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, if the <code data-x="dom-blur">blur()</code> method is unwisely
  being used to remove the focus ring for aesthetics reasons, the page would become unusable by
  keyboard users. Ignoring calls to this method would thus allow keyboard users to interact with the
  page.</p>
